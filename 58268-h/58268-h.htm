<p class="drop">BY common consent, this Work is regarded as the best comprehensive
account in the English language of the Waterloo Campaign. Even those
who differ from the Author upon particular points, most cordially admit
the general accuracy and fulness of his History. It is charmingly
written, is graphic yet precise, and abundantly witnesses to the
Author's most strenuous endeavour to do justice to every one who took
part in that great Conflict.</p>

<p>This Work will henceforth be a household book amongst the Teutonic
race; and all who read it will gain a very clear insight into the
methods of Military Strategy as they were practised by the great
Captains of that Age.</p>

<p>It is impossible to repress one's admiration of the heroic bravery
displayed in this brief Campaign: whether amongst the Allies at Quatre
Bras and Waterloo, or by the Imperial Guard at Planchenoit, or by the
Prussians at Ligny, Wavre, and Le Chesnay.</p>

<p>The reader must be good enough to observe that a Prussian Brigade then
equalled in numbers a French or an English Division.</p>

<p>This Work has extended to such great length that one half of the
<i>Appendix</i> (see pages 42 to 44) and nearly all the Notes have been,
most unwillingly, omitted. Only those Foot Notes have been inserted
which are absolutely essential to the Text. Room has however been
found, at pages 798 to 826, for the Nominal Lists of Officers at
Waterloo, &amp;c.</p>

<p>One would most earnestly wish that Wars may cease until the end of
Time; but if that may not be, then may they be as bravely fought as was
this War of Twenty Days: from the 15th June, when <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>
crossed the Sambre; to the 4th July 1815, the day on which the Allies
took possession of Paris.</p>

<p class="drop">IN graciously deigning to accept the Dedication of these pages, Your
Majesty has afforded the greatest possible encouragement to my humble
endeavours to record, with simplicity, impartiality, and truth, the
incidents of an eventful War, resulting in a long enduring Peace; a War

the British Army, and once more called forth the consummate sagacity
and far-extending prescience of that illustrious Chief, whom Your
Majesty, with wise appreciation and a just pride, retains at its head.</p>

<p class="ph2" style="margin-top: 5em;">PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.</p>


<p class="drop">IN offering to the Public this Third Edition, I feel called upon to
state, by way of explanation, in what respect it differs from the two
former Editions. During the interval which has elapsed, I have not
failed to avail myself of every opportunity to correct and improve any
points which further investigation rendered desirable; and I have been
much gratified in finding that the general plan and arrangement of the
Work, together with the elucidation of the military operations, and the
views of their tendency and effect, have been generally borne out and
approved; and that, consequently, in these respects little alteration
has been required.</p>

<p>The exceptions, which consist principally in details, and amount in
number to only four or five, have been rectified in this edition.
They are chiefly the result of discussions which have appeared in
the pages of the <i>United Service Magazine</i>; and relate to a portion
of the proceedings of Sir <span class="smcap">Colin Halkett's</span> and Sir <span class="smcap">Denis
Pack's</span> Brigades at Quatre Bras and Waterloo.</p>

<p>Through the kindness of His Excellency the Prussian Ambassador,
Chevalier <span class="smcap">Bunsen</span>, and of the Prussian Generals <span class="smcap">von
Canitz</span> and <span class="smcap">von Krauseneck</span>, and of Major <span class="smcap">Gerwien</span>
of the Prussian Head Quarters Staff; I have obtained additional
interesting details connected with the Prussian operations; more
especially as regards the opening of the Campaign.</p>

<p>A Dutch work published, apparently under authority, by Major
<span class="smcap">Van Löben Sels</span>, Aide de Camp to his Royal Highness Prince
<span class="smcap">Frederick</span> of the Netherlands, and entitled <i>B dragen tot de
Kr gsgeschiedenis van <span class="smcap">Napoleon Bonaparte</span></i>, of which I was not
previously in possession, has enabled me to give additional particulars
respecting the movements and dispositions of the most advanced portion
of the Dutch-Belgian troops, on the first advance of the Enemy; and
also to explain particular circumstances and qualify some observations
respecting those troops which appeared in former Editions.</p>

<p>The Editor of an Article in <i>The Quarterly Review</i>, No. CLI., entitled
<i>Marmont</i>, <i>Siborne</i>, and <i>Alison</i>, having, in his comments upon this
Work, denied the accuracy of one or two important facts therein stated;
I have, in notes at pages 57 and 152,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> entered into more minute
details, which explain the grounds that warrant me in adhering to the
original statements.</p>

<p>The observations made in the Preface of a Volume of "<span class="smcap">Murray</span>'s
Home and Colonial Library," entitled <i>The Story of Waterloo</i>, and the
palpable embodiment of the present Work into the pages of the latter,
have been such as could scarcely fail to attract attention; and I
have accordingly appended to this Edition, in a separate form, some
remarks upon that publication.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Public opinion (if I may judge by the
unanimous consent of the press) having so distinctly pronounced its
acknowledgment of the value of my Work, as one of History; I could not
disregard the conduct of a Writer, who, in the first place endeavours
to depreciate that value, and then unblushingly makes the most ample
and unlicensed use of it for his own purposes.</p>

<p class="ph2" style="margin-top: 5em;">PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</p>


<p class="drop">THE circumstance of the First Edition having been sold off within a
very few days, combined with the highly favourable notices taken of the
Work by professional as well as other critics, and, I may be permitted
to add, the very flattering encomiums which have been pronounced upon
it by so many who, from their position, are the most competent to
form an opinion on its merits, cannot fail to afford proofs, the most
satisfactory to the Public, and, at the same time, the most gratifying
to the Author, that, in the production of these Volumes,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> upon a
subject of such stirring national interest, neither the expectations of
the former have been altogether disappointed, nor the labours of the
latter bestowed in vain.</p>

<p>The present Edition contains corrections on one or two points of
trivial importance, to which my attention has been directed; and I
shall be happy to receive further information from surviving Eye
Witnesses who may discover any instances in which the facts related
appear either inaccurately or insufficiently explained.</p>

<p class="ph2" style="margin-top: 5em;">PREFACE.</p>


<p class="drop">SOME years ago, when constructing a Model of the Field of Waterloo,
at a particular period of the Battle; I found it necessary to make
great exertions to procure that detailed information for which I had
sought in vain in the already numerous <i>published</i> accounts of the
military transactions of 1815. Anxious to ensure the rigorous accuracy
of my work, I ventured to apply for information to nearly all the
surviving Eye Witnesses of the incidents which my Model was intended
to represent. In every quarter, and among Officers of all ranks, from
the General to the Subaltern, my applications were responded to in a
most liberal and generous spirit; and the result did indeed surprise
me, so greatly at variance was this historical evidence with the
general notions which had previously prevailed on the subject. Thus
was suggested the <i>present</i> Work. I was induced by the success of this
experiment to embrace a wider field, and to extend my enquiries over
the entire Battle; and, ultimately, throughout the Campaign itself,
from its commencement to its close.</p>

<p>Having become the depository of such valuable materials, I felt it a
duty to the honourable profession of which I am a humble member, to
submit to it, and to the World, a true and faithful account of this
memorable epoch in the history of Britain's military greatness.</p>

<p>Though not so presumptuous as to imagine that I have fully supplied
so absolute a desideratum; yet I consider myself fortunate in being
the instrument of withdrawing so far the veil from Truth. One of my
Waterloo correspondents has humorously remarked, that "if ever truth
lies at the bottom of a well, she does so immediately after a great
Battle; and it takes an amazingly long time before she can be lugged
out." The time of her emerging appears to have at length arrived; but,
while I feel that I have brought to light much that was involved in
obscurity, I cannot but be sensible that I may have fallen into errors.
Should such be the case, I shall be most ready, hereafter, to make any
corrections that may appear requisite, on my being favoured, by <i>Eye
Witnesses</i>, with further well authenticated information.</p>

<p>I take this opportunity of returning my sincere thanks to the numerous
Officers of the British Army, who have so kindly committed to my
keeping their recollections of the events which I have attempted to
describe. Similar thanks are likewise due to the Officers of the King's
German Legion and Hanoverian Subsidiary Corps; as also to the General
Officers who respectively furnished me with such information as related
to the troops of Brunswick and Nassau.</p>

<p>I beg also to express my obligations to the Prussian Minister of War,
and the Officers of the Prussian General Staff in Berlin, for the
readiness and liberality with which they have supplied me with such
details concerning the dispositions and movements of the troops of
their Sovereign, as were essential to me in prosecuting the task I had
undertaken.</p>

<p>Having briefly explained the circumstances that led to the construction
of the Work which I thus venture to place before the Public, I have now
only to express a hope that my labours may be crowned with usefulness.
Should such a result occur, I shall then have obtained the only fame I
seek.</p>

intimately involving the policy and interests of her component States,
as the escape of <span class="smcap">Napoleon Buonaparte</span> from the island of Elba,
on the 26th of February 1815&mdash;his landing in France, and his again
ascending, unopposed, that throne from which <span class="smcap">Louis XVIII.</span>
had fled with precipitation, upon learning the triumphal approach
towards the capital of his successful and formidable rival. With the
rapidity of lightning the intelligence spread itself over the whole
Continent, and with all the suddenness and violence of an electric
shock did it burst amidst the delegates from the different States, who
were then asembled in Congress at Vienna. This important Assembly, so
unexpectedly interrupted, had been called together to deliberate upon
measures of international security and prosperity; and to solve those
intricate questions of policy necessarily arising out of the various
combinations, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> in the course of a general War, carried on with
unmitigated violence, and but little intermission, for nearly a quarter
of a century, had so fatally unhinged and dismembered the previously
existing social order and polity of Europe. With one accord, a fresh
appeal to the sword was decided upon; the military resources of every
nation were again called into requisition. From State to State the cry
"To arms!" was responded to with cheerfulness and alacrity, and immense
Armies were put in motion towards the French frontier: all animated
with the sole object and fixed determination of annihilating, for ever,
the common foe whom they had already conquered; but whom, as it would
then appear, they had but ineffectually humbled.</p>

<p>The openly declared project of the Allied Sovereigns to employ
all their means, and combine all their efforts, towards the
accomplishment of the complete overthrow of the resuscitated power
of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, with whom they had determined, thenceforth,
to enter into neither truce nor treaty, was singularly favoured by
the circumstance of their Armies being still retained upon a war
establishment. The forces of the several Powers were continued on that
scale, in consequence of the difficulties experienced in the Congress
in dealing with and settling many perplexing questions of international
policy, and moderating the warmth of the discussions that took place
upon them. It was considered expedient to keep up powerful reserves,
available both for home service, and for any contingencies that might
arise out of combinations and revolts among those minor States, whose
aversion to the new political arrangements was more than suspected.
Thus it had been found necessary to detach bodies of troops from the
main bulk of the forces, in consequence of the state of the Poles
placed under the protection of Russia, and of the Saxons inhabiting
that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> portion of their country which had been ceded to Prussia; as
also, in consequence of the powerful diversion, as regarded Austria,
caused by the sudden irruption of <span class="smcap">Murat</span>, King of Naples,
into the north of Italy. Notwithstanding these necessary deductions,
however, it was found practicable to assemble, by the end of May, an
efficient force of not less than 500,000 men, upon different points
contiguous to the French frontier, with all the supplies necessary for
the prosecution of a vigorous Campaign.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The most important portion of this extensive line of frontier was
undoubtedly that which fronted the Netherlands; for although it had
been planned by the Allies that no advance was to be made by the troops
in Belgium until the remainder of their forces had reached a line of
connecting points along the French frontier, when all their Armies
were to march, in combined movement, upon the capital: still it was
reasonably to be expected that <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> would not wait for
the completion of this plan, but rather that he would endeavour, by
a decisive effort, if not to frustrate its accomplishment, at least
to diminish its efficacy. It required no great exercise of military
sagacity or political foresight to predict, that after having adopted a
maturely considered disposition of force on the most important points
along his general line of defence, and placed his frontier Fortresses
upon a respectable footing, <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> would open the tremendous
game, upon which his crown, his political existence, and the fate of
France, were now fairly staked, by a bold, sudden, and resolute advance
into Belgium&mdash;straining every nerve to vanquish, in detail, the Allied
forces in that densely populated country; of which a vast portion
was already prepared to declare in his favour. His authority once
established in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> Brussels, through the means of some great and signal
triumph, the accession to his moral influence over the entire mass of
the French nation would be immense; and then, flying to the succour of
his nearest Corps menaced from the banks of the Rhine by the approach
of hostile forces (upon which his possession of Belgium would operate
as a powerful check by the facilities thus afforded for a combined
attack in front and flank), a series of brilliant successes, supported
by fresh levies from the interior, might enable him even to dictate
terms to the Allies, who had indignantly rejected all his overtures.</p>

<p>Hence the importance of narrowly watching the Belgian frontier, and
of making due preparations for meeting any attack in that quarter,
was too obvious not to form a principal feature in the general plan
of the Allies. Its defence was assigned to an Army under the Duke of
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, comprising contingent forces from Great Britain,
from Hanover, the Netherlands, Brunswick, and Nassau; and to a Prussian
Army, under Field Marshal Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher von Wahlstadt</span>.</p>

<p>At the moment of the landing of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> on the French
shore, the only force in the Netherlands consisted, in addition
to the native troops, of a weak Anglo-Hanoverian Corps, under the
command of His Royal Highness the Prince of <span class="smcap">Orange</span>; but
the zeal, energy, and activity displayed by the Government of Great
Britain, in engrafting upon this nucleus a powerful Army, amounting
at the commencement of hostilities, to about 100,000 combatants,
notwithstanding the impediments and delays occasioned by the absence of
a considerable portion of its troops in America, were truly surprising.
At the same time, the extraordinary supply of subsidies furnished by
the British Parliament, without which not one of the Armies of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Allied Sovereigns could have commenced operations, and by means of
which England thus become the great lever whereby the whole of Europe
was set in motion towards the attainment of the one common object,
was admirably illustrative of the bold, decided, and straightforward
policy of the most determined, the most indefatigable, and the most
consistent, enemy of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>.</p>

<p>Within the same period, the Prussian forces, originally limited
to a corps of 30,000 men, under General Count <span class="smcap">Kleist von
Nollendorf</span>, occupying the Prussian territories bounded by the
Rhine, the Meuse, and the Moselle, were augmented to an effective
Army of 116,000 combatants, with all the rapidity and energy which a
keen sense of the wrongs and miseries their country had endured under
the ruthless sway of their inveterate foe, and a salutary dread of a
repetition of such infliction, could not fail to inspire.</p>

<p>Great Britain and Prussia thus occupied the post of honour, and formed
the vanguard of the mighty masses which Europe was pouring forth to
seal the doom of the <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> dynasty.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A Russian Army, under Field Marshal Count <span class="smcap">Barclay de Tolly</span>,
amounting to 167,000 men, was rapidly traversing the whole of Germany,
in three main Columns: of which the Right, commanded by General
<span class="smcap">Dochterow</span>, advanced by Kalisch, Torgau, Leipzig, Erfurt,
Hanau, Frankfort, and Hochheim, towards Mayence; the Centre, commanded
by General Baron <span class="smcap">Sacken</span>, advanced by Breslau, Dresden,
Zwickau, Baireuth, Nuremberg, Aschaffenburg, Dieburg, and Gross Gerau,
towards Oppenheim; while the Left Column, commanded by General Count
<span class="smcap">Langeron</span>, took its direction along the line of Prague, Aube,
Adelsheim, Neckar, and Heidelberg, towards Mannheim. The heads of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> the
Columns reached the Middle Rhine, when hostilities were on the point of
breaking out upon the Belgian frontier. The intimation to these troops
of another Campaign in France, and of a probable reoccupation of Paris,
had imparted new life and vigour to the spirit of inveterate hatred
and insatiable revenge which they had so thoroughly imbibed against
the French; and which had so invariably marked their career since the
memorable burning of MOSCOW.</p>

<p>An Austrian army of about 50,000 men, commanded by Field Marshal Prince
<span class="smcap">Schwartzenburg</span>, and the Army of Reserve under the Archduke
<span class="smcap">Ferdinand</span>, amounting to 40,000 men, were gradually occupying
the most important points along the right bank of the Rhine, between
Basle and Mannheim. In addition to this force, about 120,000 men were
then assembling on the plains of Lombardy, upon the termination of the
decisive Campaign against <span class="smcap">Murat</span>; which secured the deposition
of the latter, and the restoration of King <span class="smcap">Ferdinand</span> to the
throne of Naples. Vigorous and energetic measures such as these on the
part of Austria, clearly indicated that her Government, discarding
alike the circumstance of a family alliance with <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, and
the views which had once induced it to enter into a league with him and
with the Southern German States, as a security against its formidable
northern neighbours, still adhered with inflexible resolution to its
subsequently adopted policy of entering into, and fostering, a general
European compact, having for its object the complete annihilation of
the despotic sway of the ambitious Soldier Sovereign of the French.</p>

<p>The assembling also, on the Upper Rhine, of a Bavarian Army,
commanded by Prince <span class="smcap">Wrède</span>, of the Contingents of Baden and
Würtemberg, under the hereditary Prince of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> <span class="smcap">Würtemberg</span>, and
of the troops of Hesse, amounting altogether to about 80,000 men,
offered a sufficient guarantee for the line of policy espoused by the
Confederated States of the Rhine.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Formidable as was the attitude assumed by the Allies towards France,
and imposing as was their array of Armies assembling upon her frontier;
they nevertheless found their great antagonist prepared, on learning
that they had determined on an irrevocable appeal to the sword, to
throw away the scabbard. He assumed a bold and resolute posture of
defence&mdash;armed at all points, and prepared at all hazards, either
to ward off the blows of his adversaries, or to become himself
the assailant. The indefatigable exertions of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>
in restoring the Empire to its former strength and grandeur were
really astonishing; and never, perhaps, in the whole course of the
extraordinary career of that extraordinary man, did the powerful
energies of his comprehensive mind shine forth with greater brilliancy
and effect, than in his truly wonderful and incredibly rapid
development of the national resources of France on this momentous
occasion.</p>

<p>The truth of this assertion will be best confirmed by briefly
enumerating some of the most important objects accomplished within the
limited interval of three months&mdash;from his landing at Cannes, to his
taking the Field against the Allies. Among them were&mdash;the complete
overthrow of all obstacles in the way of his reascending the throne;
the reconciliation, to a very considerable extent, of the several
factions whose discordant views and interests had distracted the whole
nation; the suppression of the insurrectionary movements in La Vendée,
and the establishment of his authority over every part of the Empire;
the projection of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> various public measures, laws, and ordinances; the
remodelling of the civil and military administrations; the restoration
of the Army to its previous organisation under the Imperial Regime;
the placing of the numerous Fortresses of the kingdom in an efficient
state; the erection of fortified works around Paris, Lyons, and
other important points; the reorganisation of the National <i>Guard
d'élite</i>, to the extent of 112,000 men, divided into 200 Battalions,
and destined principally for garrisoning the Fortresses; the adoption
of the most active operations in all the arsenals, and the employment
of vast numbers of additional workmen in the manufacture of arms and
ammunition. Before all these we ought to place the raising, clothing,
arming, drilling, and organising of 410,000 men (including the National
<i>Guard d'élite</i>), which, in addition to the 149,000 men of which the
Royal Army consisted on the 1st of March, formed, on the 1st of June,
an effective force of 559,000 men, available for the national defence.</p>

<p>Of this number, the effective force of the troops of the Line
amounted to 217,000 men, and the Regimental Depôts to 146,000 men:
the remainder, consisting of 200 Battalions of the National <i>Guard
d'élite</i>, of 20 Regiments of Marines, of 10 Battalions of Marine
Artillery, of Coast Guards, Veterans, and Organised Pensioners, and
amounting to 196,000 men, constituted the <i>Armée extraordinaire</i>, to be
employed in the defence of the Fortresses and of the coast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> having calculated that an effective force of
800,000 men would be requisite to enable him to oppose the Allies
with full confidence of success, had given orders for the formation,
at the Regimental Depôts, of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th Battalions of
every Regiment of Infantry, and of the 4th and 5th Squadrons of
every Regiment of Cavalry; also for the additional formation of 30
Battalions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> of Artillery Train, of 20 Regiments of the Young Guard, of
10 Battalions of Waggon Train, and of 20 Regiments of Marines. These
and other measures he anticipated would furnish the force desired, but
not until the 1st of October. The movements of the Allies, however,
and his projected plan of active operations, precluded the possibility
of his waiting for their full accomplishment. To augment the means of
local defence, instructions were also issued for the reorganisation of
the National Guard throughout the Empire, by which it was divided into
3130 Battalions, and was to form, <i>when complete</i>, no less a force than
2,250,000 men!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Out of the disposable force of the troops of the Line, and partly also
out of the National <i>Guard d'élite</i>, were formed seven <i>Corps d'Armée</i>,
four Corps of Reserve Cavalry, four Corps of Observation, and an Army
of the West or of La Vendée.</p>

<p>The Army of the North, generally designated the Grand Army, was to be
considered as acting under the immediate orders of the Emperor. It
consisted of five <i>Corps d'Armée</i> (the First, Second, Third, Fourth,
and Sixth), all the Reserve Cavalry, and the Imperial Guard. Its total
force amounted to nearly 120,000 men; and its distribution, in the
early part of June, was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The First <i>Corps d'Armée</i> commanded by Count <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>, had
its Head Quarters at Lille; the Second, under the orders of Count
<span class="smcap">Reille</span>, was cantoned in the environs of Valenciennes; the
Third, under Count <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>, was assembled in the environs of
Mézières; the Fourth, under Count <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>, in the environs of
the Metz; and the Sixth Corps, commanded by Count <span class="smcap">Lobau</span>, was
stationed at Laon. The four Corps of Reserve Cavalry under the chief
command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> of Marshal <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>, were in cantonments between the
Aisne and the Sambre. The Imperial Guard was in Paris.</p>

<p>The Fifth <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, commanded by Count <span class="smcap">Rapp</span>, formed
the basis of an Army of the Rhine, and consisted of about 36,000 men.
Its Head Quarters were at Strasburg, and it occupied the principal
points along that part of the frontier between Landau and Hagenau;
communicating with the Fourth <i>Corps d'Armée</i> on its left, as also with
the First Corps of Observation on its right.</p>

<p>The Seventh <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, commanded by the Duke of
<span class="smcap">Albufera</span>, formed the basis of the Army of the Alps. It did
not at that time amount to more than 15,000 men; but arrangements were
made for its augmentation, by the end of June, to 40,000 men. It held
the passes along the Italian frontier&mdash;was strongly posted at Grenoble,
and at Chambery&mdash;communicating on its left with the First Corps of
Observation; and covering the approach to Lyons, where very extensive
works were carried on with the utmost vigour and activity.</p>

<p>The First Corps of Observation, called the Army of the Jura, commanded
by Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">Lecourbe</span>, guarded the passes along the
Swiss frontier; had its Head Quarters at Altkirch, and occupied the
line between Huningen and Belfort&mdash;communicating on its right with the
Army of the Alps, and on its left with the Army of the Rhine. It did
not, at that time, consist of a larger force than 4,500 men; which,
however, was to be augmented to 18,000 on the arrival of additional
Battalions from the National <i>Guard d'élite</i> then in course of active
organisation.</p>

<p>The Second Corps of Observation, called the Army of the Var, commanded
by Marshal <span class="smcap">Brune</span>, had its Head Quarters at Marseilles;
occupied Toulon and Antibes, and watched the frontier of the Maritime
Alps. Its force, which then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> amounted to 5,300 men, was to be joined by
sixteen Battalions of the National <i>Guard d'élite</i>; and, in this way,
increased to 17,000 men.</p>

<p>The Third Corps of Observation, called the Army of the Eastern
Pyrenees, commanded by Lieutenant General Count <span class="smcap">Decaen</span>, had
its Head Quarters at Perpignan. It did not then consist of more than
3,000 men; but was to be augmented by thirty-two Battalions of the
National <i>Guard d'élite</i> to 23,000 men.</p>

<p>The Fourth Corps of Observation, called the Army of the Western
Pyrenees, or of the Gironde, was commanded by Lieutenant General
<span class="smcap">Clausel</span>; had its Head Quarters in Bordeaux; consisted of the
same force as that of the Third Corps; and was to be augmented in a
similar manner.</p>

<p>The Army of La Vendée, commanded by General <span class="smcap">Lamarque</span>, was
occupied in restoring tranquillity to that part of the Empire.
It consisted of about 17,000 men, including Detachments supplied
temporarily from the Third and Fourth Corps of Observation.</p>

<p>Arrangements had also been made for reinforcing, at the end of June,
the two Armies of the Rhine and the Alps, with 50,000 men from the
troops of the Line organised in the Regimental Depôts, and with
100,000 men from the National <i>Guard d'élite</i>; and with a view to
afford a Second Line and Support to the Grand Army, commanded by
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> in person, the latter was to be augmented by 100,000
men of the National Guard, and by 60,000 men of regular troops taken
from the Depôts, where the additional Battalions and Squadrons of
Regiments were in course of daily organisation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The general aspect of France at that moment was singularly warlike. It
was that of a whole nation buckling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> on its armour; over the entire
country armed bodies were to be seen in motion towards their several
points of destination: every where the new levies for the Line, and
the newly enrolled National Guards were in an unremitting course
of drill and organisation: the greatest activity was maintained,
day and night, in all the arsenals, and in all the manufactories of
clothing and articles of equipment: crowds of workmen were constantly
employed in the repair of the numerous Fortresses, and in the erection
of entrenched works. Every where appeared a continued transport of
artillery, waggons, arms, ammunition, and all the material of war;
whilst upon every road forming an approach to any of the main points
of assembly in the vicinity of the frontiers, might be seen those
well-formed veteran bands, <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s followers through many
a bloody field, moving forth with all the order, and with all the
elasticity of spirit, inspired by the full confidence of a renewed
career of victory&mdash;rejoicing in the display of those Standards which so
proudly recalled the most glorious Fields that France had ever won, and
testifying by their acclamations, their enthusiastic devotion to the
cause of the Emperor, which was ever cherished by them as identified
with that of their country.</p>

<p>The sentiments which so generally animated the troops of the Line,
must not, however, be understood as having been equally imbibed
by the remaining portion of the Army, or indeed by the major part
of the nation. There was one predominant cause, which, though its
influence acted as an additional stimulus to the Army, was, to a
very considerable extent, the sole incentive to exertion with the
civil portion of the community. It was the general prevalence of
that unconquerable aversion and undisguised contempt entertained by
the French for the mass of their foreign invaders, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> former
humiliation and subjection, the result of an almost uninterrupted
course of victory and triumph to which the history of France presented
no parallel, had served to flatter and to gratify the national vanity.
It was this feeling, combined with a dread of that retributive justice
which would inevitably follow in the train of a successful invasion,
that operated so powerfully upon the mass of the nation, with whom the
cry of "<i>Vive l'Empereur!</i>" merged into that of "<i>Vive la France!</i>"</p>

<p>To the above cause may also be traced the temporary reconciliation
of the different factions which it was one of the main objects of
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s celebrated <i>Champ de Mai</i> to establish. This
Convocation of the Popular Representatives, which had in a measure been
forced upon the Emperor by the political vantage ground the people
had gained during even the short constitutional reign of <span class="smcap">Louis
XVIII.</span>, and of which they had begun to feel the benefit, did not
in any degree fulfil the expectations of its projector. The stern
Republicans were dissatisfied with the retention of a Chamber of Peers,
which, in the late reign, they had regarded as an English importation;
and the Royalists were no less disgusted with the materials out of
which such a Chamber had been constructed; while both parties felt
it to be a mere semblance of a constitutional body, destined to be
composed of the willing slaves of the despot, his ready instruments for
counteracting and paralysing the effects of any violent ebullition of
the popular will.</p>

<p>When it is considered that an overwhelming majority of the members of
the new Chamber of Deputies were men of avowed Republican principles,
and that in their very first sittings, they evinced by the tone of
their debates, and by the tenor of their measures, a determination to
uphold the authority vested in them by the people, and to make even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
the military power of the Emperor subservient to their views of Popular
Government; when, also, it is considered that the two predominant
Parties in the State, the Republicans and the Royalists, relied upon,
and awaited but, the issue of events, for the ultimate success and
realisation of their respective principles: it need not excite surprise
that <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, on quitting the capital to take the Field,
should have appeared to feel that he left behind him a power even more
dangerous to the stability of his authority, and more destructive of
his ambitious projects, than that which he was going personally to
confront. He naturally calculated largely upon the enthusiasm of his
troops and their devotion to his cause: but he must have entertained
serious doubts as to whether this spirit was shared by the great
majority of the nation; and must have foreseen that it would only be
by means of a successful result of the approaching contest, that he
could possibly avert the dangers to which his sovereignty was exposed,
as much by the machinations of political opponents at home, as by
the combinations of hostile forces abroad. He was now made painfully
sensible of the vast change which the result of all his former Wars,
the restoration of the legitimate Monarch, and the newly chartered
Liberty of the Subject, had gradually wrought in the political feelings
and sentiments of the Nation.</p>

<p>In short, he found that he had to contend with a mighty, and
an uncontrollable, power&mdash;the great moral power of Public
Opinion&mdash;compared with which, the Military Power, centred in a single
Individual, however brilliant the latter in genius and in conception,
however fertile in expedients, and however daring and successful in
enterprise and in execution, can acquire no permanent stability, when
not based upon, and emanating from, the broad and comprehensive moral
energies of the Nation; and even a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> succession of dazzling triumphs,
when gained through the instrumentality of an arbitrary drain upon
the national resources, and in opposition to the real interests and
welfare of the State, tends but to hasten the downfall of the Military
Dictator: whose career may be aptly likened to a Grecian column
erected upon a loose foundation, displaying around its lofty capital
an exuberance of meretricious ornament, which, by its disproportionate
weight, destroys the equilibrium of the ill-supported shaft, and
involves the entire structure in one confused and irretrievable ruin.
Its fall may startle the world with its shock; the fragments may strew
the earth in a wreck as gigantic as were its proportions when it drew
the gaze of admiring or trembling nations: but they are but the more
striking proofs of the destruction that has overtaken it;&mdash;it is a ruin
still.</p>

<p class="drop">BELGIUM, the frequent battle-ground of Europe, whose every stream and
every town is associated with the memory of bygone deeds of arms,
was destined, in 1815, to witness another and a mighty struggle&mdash;a
struggle in which were arrayed, on the one side, the two foremost of
the confederated Armies advancing towards the French frontiers; and, on
the other, the renowned <i>Grande Armée</i> of Imperial France, resuscitated
at the magic call of its original founder&mdash;the great <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>
himself. During the months of April and May, troops of all arms
continued to enter upon, and spread themselves over, the Belgian soil.</p>

<p>Here might be seen the British soldier, flushed with recent triumphs
in the Peninsula over the same foe with whom he was now prepared
once more to renew the combat; and here the Prussian, eager for the
deadly strife, and impatiently rushing onward to encounter that enemy
whose ravages and excesses in his Fatherland still rankled in his
memory. The Englishman was not fired by the desire of retribution;
for it had pleased Divine Providence to spare Great Britain from the
scourge of domestic war, and to preserve her soil unstained by the
footprint of a foreign enemy. The Prussian soldier looked forward
with a sullen pleasure to the prospect of revenge: vengeance seemed
to him a sacred duty, imposed upon him by all the ties of kindred,
and by all those patriotic feelings, which, in the hour of Prussia's
need, had roused her entire people from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> the abject state to which
they had been so fatally subdued; which, when the whole country lay
prostrate at the conqueror's feet, so wonderfully, so powerfully, and
so successfully prompted her sons to throw off the yoke. History will
mark this deliverance as the brilliant point in Prussia's brightest
era, affording as it does, a clear and beautiful parallel to that in
which an equally forcible appeal to the energies of the nation was
made with similar success by that illustrious Statesman and General,
<span class="smcap">Frederick the Great</span>, when opposed single-handed to the immense
Armies and powerful resources of surrounding States. France was about
to expiate by her own sufferings the wrongs she had wrought upon his
country and his kind, and the Prussian panted for an opportunity of
satiating his revenge.</p>

<p>The Briton, if he had no such spur as that which urged the Prussian
soldier forward, did not want a sufficiently exciting stimulus; he
cherished, in an eminent degree, that high feeling and proud bearing
which a due sense of the obligations imposed on him by his country, and
of her anxious expectations of his prowess, could not fail to inspire;
determined resolutely and cheerfully to discharge the former, and, if
possible, to more than realise the latter.</p>

<p class="caption">Wellington</p>

<p>These feelings and dispositions of the soldiery in the two most
advanced of the Allied Armies were concentrated with remarkable
intensity in the characters of their respective Chiefs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>With peculiar propriety may it be said of the illustrious
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, that he personified, as he ever has done, the
pure ideal of the British soldier&mdash;the true character of his own
followers. Resolute, yet cool, cautious and calculating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> in his
proceedings; possessing a natural courage unshaken even under the
most appalling dangers and difficulties; placing great yet not vain
reliance upon physical and moral strength, as opposed to the force
of numbers;&mdash;it was not surprising that he should have inspired with
unbounded confidence, soldiers who could not but see in his character
and conduct the reflection and stamp of their own qualities, the worth
of which he so well knew, and which he had so often proved during the
arduous struggle that had been brought to so brilliant and so glorious
a conclusion. But besides these traits in his character, which so
completely identified him with a British Army, there were others which
peculiarly distinguished him as one of the greatest Captains that his
own or any other nation ever produced, and which might well inspire
confidence as to the result of the approaching contest, even opposed
as he was to the hero of a hundred fights, with whom he was now, for
the first time, to measure swords. The eagle glance with which he
detected the object of every hostile movement and the promptitude with
which he decided upon, and carried into effect, the measures necessary
to counteract the Enemy's efforts; the lightning-like rapidity with
which he conducted his attacks, founded as they frequently were upon
the instantaneously discovered errors of his opponents; the noble and
unexampled presence of mind with which he surveyed the battlefield, and
with which he gave his orders and instructions; unaffected by merely
temporary success, unembarrassed by sudden difficulties, and undismayed
by unexpected danger; the many proofs which his operations in the
Peninsula had afforded of his accurate knowledge, just conception,
and skilful discrimination, of the true principles of the Science of
Strategy&mdash;all tended to point him out as the individual best fitted
by his abilities, his experience, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> his character, to head the
military array assembled to decide the all-important question whether
the Star of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> was to regain the ascendant, or to set
in darkness; whether his iron despotism was again to erect its mighty
head, or to be now struck down and crushed&mdash;finally and effectually
crushed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The character of the Commander of the Prussian Army in this memorable
Campaign, the veteran Marshal Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher von Wahlstadt</span>,
was, in like manner, peculiarly adapted for concentrating within itself
all those feelings and emotions already adverted to as animating this
portion of the enemies of France&mdash;possessing, to a degree bordering
on rashness, a high spirited daring in enterprise; distinguished, on
critical occasions in the field, when the unrestrained feelings and
nature of the <i>ci-devant</i> bold Hussar started forth in aid of the
veteran Commander, by a personal display of chivalrous and impetuous
bravery; ever vigilant for an opportunity of harassing his Enemy;
and fixedly relentless in the pursuit, so long as he retained the
mastery; qualities, which, in his own country, had acquired for him the
sobriquet of <i>Marschall <span class="smcap">Vorwärts</span></i>&mdash;he was eminently fitted to
be both the representative and the leader of the Prussians.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here, too, in close alliance and amity with the British soldier, were
seen the German Legionary, the Hanoverian, and the Brunswicker, who had
so nobly shared with him, under the same Chief, all the toils and all
the glories of the War in the Peninsula; and who were now prepared to
defend the threatened liberties of their respective countries, the very
existence of which, as independent States, hung upon the issue of the
impending struggle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>Although the British were but little acquainted with their other
Allies, the Dutch, the Belgians, and the Nassau troops in the service
of the King of the Netherlands, still the fact that it was upon their
own soil the brunt of the coming contest was to fall, and in all
probability to decide the question whether it should become a portion
of Imperial France, or continue an independent State, coupled with the
knowledge which the British troops possessed of the character of the
Prince at their head, who had gained his laurels under their own eyes,
and who had thus ingratiated himself in their favour, encouraged great
hopes of their hearty exertions in the common cause.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was naturally to be expected that <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, from the
moment he reascended the throne of his former glory, would devote the
utmost energies of his all-directing mind to the full development of
whatever military means France, notwithstanding her recent reverses,
yet retained; but the rapidity and the order with which so regular and
so well organised a force as that which was now concentrating on the
French side of the Sambre, had been collected and put in motion, were
truly wonderful. The speedy and almost sudden reappearance of the old
Army in all its grandeur, with its Corps and Divisions headed by men,
who, by a series of daring and successful exploits, had proved their
just titles to command, and endeared themselves to the old campaigners,
was such that it seemed as if the French had realised the fable of the
dragon's teeth, which it might be said they had sown as they crossed
their frontiers in the previous year, when retreating upon the capital
before the victorious Allies. Never did any Army contain within itself
so much of that necessary essence in the composition of a military
force,&mdash;unbounded enthusiasm, combined with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> the purest devotion to
its leader. The oft-told tale of the veteran of so many a hard-fought
field, indulging in the hope of aiding by his exertions, at any
sacrifice, in again carrying the Eagles to the scenes of their former
triumphs, excited the ardour of many a youthful aspirant to share with
him the glory of wiping out the stain which had dimmed the lustre of
his country's fame, and darkened a most eventful page in her annals.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such being the nature of the elements ready to rush into collision, it
was easy to foresee that the shock which that collision would produce,
would be both violent and terrible; but no one could have anticipated
that within the short space of four days from the commencement of
hostilities, the die would be irrevocably cast, annihilating for ever
the imperial sway of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, and securing to Europe one of
the longest periods of peace recorded in her history.</p>

<p>The Infantry was divided into two Corps and a Reserve.</p>


<p>The First Corps, commanded by General His Royal Highness the Prince of
<span class="smcap">Orange</span>, was composed</p>

<blockquote>

<p>of the First Division, under Major General <span class="smcap">Cooke</span>;</p>

<p>of the Third Division, under Lieutenant General Sir <span class="smcap">Charles
Alten</span>;</p>

<p>of the Second Dutch-Belgian Division, under Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">de
Perponcher</span>;</p>

<p>and of the Third Dutch-Belgian Division, under Lieutenant General
Baron <span class="smcap">Chassé</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Left of this Corps rested upon Genappe, Quatre Bras, and Frasne,
on the high road leading from Brussels to Charleroi on the Sambre,
and communicated with the Right of the First <i>Corps d'Armée</i> of the
Prussian Army, the Head Quarters of which Corps were at Charleroi.
<span class="smcap">De Perponcher</span>'s Dutch-Belgian Division formed the extreme
Left, having its Head Quarters at Nivelles, on the high road from
Brussels to Binche. On its right was <span class="smcap">Chassé</span>'s Dutch-Belgian
Division, more in advance, in the direction of Mons and Binche, and
quartered principally in Roeulx, and in the villages between the latter
place and Binche. The next Division on the right was <span class="smcap">Alten</span>'s,
having its Head Quarters at Soignies, on the high road from Brussels
to Mons, and occupying villages between this town, Roeulx, Braine le
Comte, and Enghien. The Right Division, <span class="smcap">Cooke</span>'s, had its Head
Quarters at Enghien.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>


<p>The Second Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Lord <span class="smcap">Hill</span>,
consisted</p>

<blockquote>

<p>of the Second Division, under Lieutenant General Sir <span class="smcap">Henry
Clinton</span>;</p>

<p>of the Fourth Division, under Lieutenant General the Hon. Sir
<span class="smcap">Charles Colville</span>;</p>

<p>of the First Dutch-Belgian Division, under Lieutenant General
<span class="smcap">Stedmann</span>;</p>

<p>and of a Brigade raised for service in the Dutch Colonies, called the
Indian Brigade, under Lieutenant General Baron <span class="smcap">Anthing</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Second Division, which formed the Left of this Corps, communicated
with <span class="smcap">Alten</span>'s Right; its Head Quarters were at Ath, on the
Dender, and upon the high road leading from Brussels to Tournai, and
one Brigade (the Third), occupied Lens, situated about midway between
Ath and Mons.</p>

<p>The Fourth Division was the next on the right, having its Head Quarters
at Audenarde on the Scheldt, and occupying also Renaix. One Brigade
of this Division (the Sixth Hanoverian) garrisoned the fortress of
Nieuport on the coast. The First Dutch-Belgian Division was cantoned in
villages bordering upon the high road connecting Grammont with Ghent;
and the so-called Indian Brigade occupied villages between this line
and Alost.</p>

<p>The Reserve consisted</p>

<blockquote>

<p>of the Fifth Division, under Lieutenant General Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas
Picton</span>;</p>

<p>of the Sixth Division, under Lieutenant General the Hon. Sir <span class="smcap">Lowry
Cole</span>;</p>

<p>of the Brunswick Division, under the Duke of <span class="smcap">Brunswick</span>;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>of the Hanoverian Corps, under Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">von der
Decken</span>;</p>

<p>and of the Contingent of the Duke of <span class="smcap">Nassau</span>, which comprised
the 1st Regiment of Nassau Infantry, containing three Battalions, and
forming a Brigade under the command of General <span class="smcap">von Kruse</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Fifth and Sixth Divisions, and the Brunswick Division, were
quartered principally in and around Brussels, excepting the Seventh
Brigade, which together with <span class="smcap">von der Decken</span>'s Corps, the 13th
Veteran Battalion, the 1st Foreign Battalion, and the 2nd Garrison
Battalion, garrisoned Antwerp, Ostend, Nieuport, Ypres, Tournai, and
Mons; and <span class="smcap">von Kruse</span>'s Nassau Brigade was cantoned between
Brussels and Louvain.</p>

<p>Of the fortresses already mentioned, those which had not been destroyed
by the French when they gained possession of the country in 1794,
namely, Antwerp, Ostend, and Nieuport, were strengthened, and each
rendered capable of holding out a siege. By taking every possible
advantage offered by the remains of the old fortifications, and by
the continued employment of 20,000 labourers, through requisitions on
the country, in addition to the military working parties, and by the
accession of artillery and stores from England and Holland, the towns
of Ypres, Tournai, Mons, Ath, and the Citadel of Ghent, were placed
in a state of defence, and a Redoubt was constructed at Audenarde to
protect the Sluice Gates, which afforded the means of inundating that
part of the country.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Cavalry of the Anglo-Allied Army, commanded by Lieutenant General
the Earl of <span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span>, consisted of seven Brigades, comprising
the British and the King's German Legion; of a Hanoverian Brigade;
of five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> Squadrons of Brunswick Cavalry; and of three Brigades of
Dutch-Belgian Cavalry.</p>

<p>The British and King's German Legion Cavalry, with the Hanoverian
Brigade, were stationed at Grammont and Ninove, and in villages
bordering upon the Dender. The Brunswick Cavalry was dispersed in
the vicinity of Brussels. The First Brigade of Dutch-Belgian Cavalry
was cantoned in the neighbourhood of Roeulx; the Second Brigade, in
villages between Roeulx and Mons; and the Third Brigade, partly on the
south side of Mons, in the direction of Maubeuge and Beaumont, and
partly between Binche and Mons.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The wide dissemination of the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s forces
which the advanced line of cantonments presented&mdash;a line forming a
considerable portion of a circle, of which Brussels was the centre, and
the Tournai, Mons, and Charleroi roads were the marked radii&mdash;tended
greatly to facilitate the means of subsisting the troops, and to
render that subsistence less burthensome to the country; while,
at the same time, it offered to the Duke, in conjunction with the
interior points of concentration, and with the efficient Reserve
stationed around the capital, full security for his being prepared
to meet any emergency that might arise. The main points of interior
concentration were (commencing from the right) Audenarde, Grammont,
Ath, Enghien, Soignies, Nivelles, and Quatre Bras. From whatever
point, therefore, offensive operations might be directed against
that portion of the Belgian frontier occupied by the Army under
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>&mdash;whether from Lille, by Courtrai, or by Tournai,
between the Lys and the Scheldt; from Condé, Valenciennes, or Maubeuge,
by Mons, between the Sambre and the Scheldt; or from Maubeuge,
Beaumont, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> Philippeville, by Charleroi, between the Sambre and the
Meuse&mdash;the Duke, by advancing to the threatened point with his Reserve,
and placing the remainder of his troops in movement, had it in his
power to concentrate at least two-thirds of his intended disposable
force for the Field, upon the line of the Enemy's operations, within
twenty-two hours after the receipt of intelligence of the actual
direction and apparent object of those operations.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Prussian Army, under the command of Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher von

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">and of an Artillery Reserve, under Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Bardeleben</span>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The Head Quarters of this Corps were at Liege, where was also stationed
the Thirteenth Infantry Brigade; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> Fourteenth Brigade was cantoned
in and around Waremme; the Fifteenth Brigade at Hologne; the Sixteenth
Brigade at Liers; the First Brigade of Reserve Cavalry at Tongern; the
Second Brigade at Dalhem, and the Third Brigade at Lootz; the Reserve
Artillery was cantoned in and about Gloms and Dalhem.</p>

<p>Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s Head Quarters were at Namur.</p>

<p>The points of concentration for the respective Corps were therefore
Fleurus, Namur, Ciney, and Liege. The four Corps were so disposed that
each could be collected at its own Head Quarters within twelve hours;
and it was fully practicable to form a junction of the whole Army at
any one of these points within twenty-four hours from the time of such
collection. At Namur, the most central point, it would of course be
accomplished in much less time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blücher</span> had decided, in the event of an advance by the French
across the line of the Sambre, by Charleroi, upon concentrating his
Army in a position in front of Sombref, a point upon the high road
between Namur and Nivelles, above fourteen miles from the former
place, and only seven miles and a half from Quatre Bras, the point of
intersection of this road with the one leading directly from Charleroi
to Brussels, and at which <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> had agreed, in that case,
to concentrate as large a force as time would admit, in order to check
any advance in this direction, or to join <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s Right
Flank, according to circumstances.</p>

<a id="illus07" name="illus07"></a></p>


<p class="caption">Blücher</p>

<p>Should the Enemy advance along the left bank of the Meuse towards
Namur, this place would become the point of junction of the First,
Second, and Fourth Corps of the Prussian Army, whilst the Third,
collecting at Ciney, would, after presenting a stout resistance at
Dinant, operate as effectively as circumstances would admit, against
the Right of the line of attack; and should he advance by the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
bank of the Meuse towards Ciney, the Army would concentrate at this
point, with the exception of the Fourth Corps, which would assemble at
Liege as a Reserve, for the better security of the Left Flank and of
the communications with the Rhine.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such were the dispositions of the Allied Commanders, who contemplated
no change in their arrangements until the moment should arrive of the
commencement of hostile demonstrations of a decided character, for
which they were perfectly prepared, and for which a vigilant look-out
was maintained along the general line of the Advanced Posts.</p>

<p>From the foregoing, however, it would appear that the concentration
of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Army on its own Left, and that of
<span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s Army on its own Right, required longer time than
that in which they could have been respectively accomplished on other
points; and further that the distribution of the former was better
calculated to meet the Enemy's advance by Mons, and that of the latter
to meet it by Namur, than to oppose a line of attack by Charleroi. This
peculiar feature in the dispositions of the two Commanders did not
escape the vigilance of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, who, as will be seen in the
sequel, made it subservient to his hopes of beating their Armies in
detail.</p>

<p>The French troops destined to constitute the Grand Army with which
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> had decided upon taking the field against the allied

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Attached to the Guard were 6 Batteries of Foot, and 4 Batteries of
Horse, Artillery, with 3 Batteries of Reserve Artillery; comprising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>altogether 96 pieces of cannon, under the command of Lieutenant
General <span class="smcap">Desvaux de St. Maurice</span>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>These troops were principally in Paris.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The French Emperor having, upon the grounds explained in a former
Chapter, determined to take the Field against the Allied Armies in
Belgium, the commencement of active operations could no longer be
deferred. When we reflect upon the disparity of force with which he
was going to contend against two such Generals as <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>
and <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, we are bound to acknowledge that it was an
undertaking daring and perilous in the extreme, even for an individual
of the dauntless and adventurous character of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>. A
delay of only a few weeks would have secured for him, by means of
the vast organisation which was in constant and rapid progress, a
sufficient accession of disposable troops to have enabled him to
effect a powerful diversion upon either <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Right,
or <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s Left, Flank, and thus to impart an infinitely
greater degree of weight and stability to his main operations; but
then, on the other hand, this delay would also have brought the
powerful Armies of the confederated Sovereigns across the whole line of
his eastern frontier, and have led to the consummation of that combined
movement upon the capital, the execution of which it was his great aim
to frustrate.</p>

<p>But it was not the first time that <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> had advanced
against such fearful superiority of numerical strength. In the previous
year, when nearly surrounded by the victorious forces of Prussia,
Austria, and Russia, when apparently overwhelmed by a succession of
disasters, and when his Army was daily diminishing by the desertion of
newly raised conscripts, and presenting the mere wreck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> of its former
self, he was at the very <i>acme</i> of his mental energy, and in the full
possession of his determinate and all subduing will. His great genius
seemed to acquire additional vigour and elasticity, with the increasing
desperation of his position; and darting with electric suddenness and
rapidity, now upon one adversary and then upon another, maintaining
with the renowned leaders of his detached forces, a combination of
movements developing the highest order of strategy, he succeeded by his
brilliant triumphs at Champaubert, Montmirail, and Monterau, not only
in stemming the torrent of invasion, but in causing the resumption of
the diplomatic preliminaries of a Peace. This Peace, however, these
very triumphs induced him, as if by a fatality, to reject with scorn
and indignation, although the terms were honourable in the highest
degree under his then existing circumstances.</p>

<p>Hence, with such a retrospect, <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> might well indulge
in hope and confidence as to the result of the approaching Campaign,
notwithstanding the want of sufficient time for a greater development
of his resources. A finer or a more gallant Army, or one more complete
and efficient in every respect, than that which he was going to lead in
person, never took the Field.</p>

<p class="figcenter" ><img src="images/illus08.jpg" alt="cap" />
<a id="illus08" name="illus08"></a></p>
<p class="caption">Napoleon</p>

<p>He had selected for the line of his main operations the direct road
to Brussels, by Charleroi, that being the road, as before remarked,
on which <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Left, and <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s Right
respectively rested, and which he designed to maintain by first
overcoming the Prussian Army, which was the most advanced on that
line, and then attacking the Anglo-Allied troops before they could
be collected in sufficient strength to prevent his further progress;
his grand object being to impede the junction of the two Armies; to
vanquish them in detail; to establish himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> in Brussels; to arouse
the dense population in Belgium, of which a vast proportion secretly
adhered to his cause; to reannex the country to the French Empire;
to excite the desertion of the Belgian soldiery from the service
of Holland; to prevent a check by these means to the operations of
the invading Armies crossing the Rhine; perhaps also to enter into
negotiations; and, at all events, to gain, what was to him of vital
importance, <i>time</i> for the advance and co-operation of further
reinforcements from France.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The necessary Orders were now despatched for the concentration of the
Grand Army; and in order to mask its movements as much as possible,
the whole line of the Belgian frontier was studded with numerous
Detachments of the National Guards furnished by the garrisons of the
fortresses, more especially along that part of the frontier which
passes in advance of Valenciennes, Condé, Lille, and even as far as
Dunkirk; all the <i>debouchés</i> of which line were strongly occupied, the
Outposts tripled, and there was every apparent indication that either
the principal attack, or at least a formidable diversion, was in course
of preparation in that quarter.</p>

<p>These measures had the effect of strengthening the anticipations which
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span> had previously formed of offensive movements from
the side of Lille and Valenciennes, and consequently of placing him
still more upon his guard against any hasty and incautious junction of
his forces with those of <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, until fully satisfied as to
the true direction and object of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s main operations.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the 12th of June, Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Wissell</span>, whose
Regiment, the 1st Hussars of the King's German Legion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> formed an
extensive line of Outposts in front of Tournai, reported to Major
General Sir <span class="smcap">Hussey Vivian</span>, to whose Brigade the Regiment
belonged, that he had ascertained, from information on which he could
rely, that the French Army had assembled on the frontier, and was
prepared to attack. <span class="smcap">Vivian</span> desired him to report upon the
subject to Lord <span class="smcap">Hill</span>, to whose Corps his Regiment was attached
while employed on this particular service.</p>

<p>The next morning, <span class="smcap">Vivian</span> repaired in person to the Outposts,
and found that a French Cavalry Picquet which had previously been
posted opposite to Tournai, had a short time before marched to join
the main Army, and had been relieved by <i>Douaniers</i>. These, upon being
spoken to by <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>, did not hesitate to say that their Army
was concentrating, and that if the Allies did not advance, their
troops would attack. On returning to his Quarters, <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>
communicated what he had seen and heard both to Lord <span class="smcap">Hill</span> and
the Earl of <span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span>, by whom the circumstances were made
known to the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>. His Grace, however, for
reasons before stated, did not think the proper moment had arrived for
making any alteration in the disposition of his forces.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Gérard</span>'s Corps quitted Metz on the 6th of June, with Orders
to reach Philippeville by the 14th. The Imperial Guard began its march
from Paris on the 8th, and reached Avesnes on the 13th, as did also
<span class="smcap">Lobau</span>'s Corps from Laon. <span class="smcap">D'Erlon</span>'s Corps from Lille,
<span class="smcap">Reille</span>'s Corps from Valenciennes, and <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>'s
Corps from Mézières, likewise arrived at Maubeuge and Avesnes on the
13th. The four Corps of Reserve Cavalry concentrated upon the Upper
Sambre.</p>

<p>The junction of the several Corps on the same day, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> almost at
the same hour (with the exception of the Fourth, which joined the
next day), displayed the usual skill of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> in the
combination of movements. Their leaders congratulated themselves upon
these auspicious preparations, and upon finding the "Grand Army" once
more assembled in "all the pomp and circumstance of glorious war:"
the appearance of the troops, though fatigued, was all that could be
desired; and their enthusiasm was at the highest on hearing that the
Emperor himself, who had quitted Paris at three o'clock on the morning
of the 12th, and passed the night at Laon, had actually arrived amongst
them.</p>

<p>Upon the following day, the French Army bivouacked on three different
points.</p>

<p>The Left, consisting of <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s and <span class="smcap">Reille</span>'s Corps,
and amounting to about 44,000 men, was posted on the right bank of the
Sambre at Solre sur Sambre.</p>

<p>The Centre, consisting of <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>'s and <span class="smcap">Lobau</span>'s
Corps, of the Imperial Guard, and of the Cavalry Reserves, amounting
altogether to about 60,000 men, was at Beaumont, which was made the
Head Quarters.</p>

<p>The Right, composed of <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>'s Corps and of a Division of
Heavy Cavalry, amounting altogether to about 16,000 men, was in front
of Philippeville.</p>

<p>The bivouacs were established in rear of some slight eminences, with a
view to conceal their fires from the observation of the Enemy.</p>

<p>The Army, while thus assembled, on the eve of opening the Campaign,
received through the medium of an <i>Ordre du Jour</i> the following
spirit-stirring appeal from its Chief:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>

"<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, by the Grace of God, and the Constitutions of the Empire,<br />
Emperor of the French, etc., to the Grand Army,</p>

<p style="margin-left: 60%;">"At the Imperial Head Quarters,<br />
Avesnes, June 14th, 1815.<br />
</p>

<p>"Soldiers! this day is the anniversary of Marengo and of Friedland,
which twice decided the destiny of Europe. Then, as after
Austerlitz, as after Wagram, we were too generous! We believed in
the protestations and in the oaths of Princes, whom we left on their
thrones. Now, however, leagued together, they aim at the independence,
and the most sacred rights of France. They have commenced the most
unjust of aggressions. Let us, then, march to meet them. Are they and
we no longer the same men?</p>

<p>"Soldiers! at Jena, against these same Prussians, now so arrogant, you
were one to three, and at Montmirail one to six!</p>

<p>"Let those among you who have been captives to the English, describe
the nature of their prison ships, and the frightful miseries they
endured.</p>

<p>"The Saxons, the Belgians, the Hanoverians, the soldiers of the
Confederation of the Rhine, lament that they are compelled to use
their arms in the cause of the Princes, the enemies of justice and
of the rights of all nations. They know that this Coalition is

millions of Italians, one million of Saxons, and six millions of
Belgians, it now wishes to devour the States of the second rank in

<p class="drop">NAPOLEON by his precautionary measures of strengthening his
Advanced Posts, and of displaying along the whole line of the Belgian
frontier an equal degree of vigilance and activity, had effectually
concealed from his adversaries the combined movements of his several
<i>Corps d'Armée</i>, and their concentration on the right bank of the
Sambre.</p>

<p>During the night of the 13th, however, the light reflected upon the
sky by the fires of the French bivouacs, did not escape the vigilant
observation of <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Outposts, whence it was communicated
to the Rear that these fires appeared to be in the direction of
Walcourt and of Beaumont, and also in the vicinity of Solre sur
Sambre; further, that all reports received through spies and deserters
concurred in representing that <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> was expected to join
the French Army on that evening; that the Imperial Guard and the Second
Corps had arrived at Avesnes and Maubeuge; also that, at one o'clock in
the afternoon of that day, four French Battalions had crossed the river
at Solre sur Sambre, and occupied Merbes le Château; that late in the
night the Enemy had pushed forward a strong Detachment as far as Sart
la Bussière; and lastly, that an attack by the French would certainly
take place on the 14th or 15th.</p>

<p>On the 14th of June, the Dutch-Belgian General <span class="smcap">van Merlen</span>,
who was stationed at St Symphorien, near Mons, and who commanded the
Outposts between the latter place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> and Binche which formed the extreme
Right of the Prussians, ascertained that the French troops had moved
from Maubeuge and its vicinity by Beaumont towards Philippeville, that
there was no longer any hostile force in his front, except a Picquet at
Bettignies, and some National Guards in other villages. He forwarded
this important information to the Prussian General <span class="smcap">Steinmetz</span>,
on his left, with whom he was in constant communication, and by whom it
was despatched to General <span class="smcap">Zieten</span> at Charleroi.</p>

<p>The Prussian General <span class="smcap">Pirch II.</span>, who was posted on the left
of <span class="smcap">Steinmetz</span>, also sent word to <span class="smcap">Zieten</span> that he
had received information through his Outposts that the French Army
had concentrated in the vicinity of Beaumont and Merbes le Château;
that their Army consisted of 150,000 men, and was commanded by
General <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>, <span class="smcap">Jerome Buonaparte</span>, and some other
distinguished Officers; that since the previous day all crossing of the
frontier had been forbidden by the French under pain of death; and that
a Patrol of the Enemy had been observed that day near Biercée, not far
from Thuin.</p>

<p>During the day, frequent accounts were brought to the troops of
<span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Corps, generally corroborative of the above, by the
country people who were bringing away, and seeking some place of safety
for, their cattle. Intelligence was also obtained of the arrival of
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, and of his brother, Prince <span class="smcap">Jerome</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zieten</span> immediately transmitted the substance of this
information to Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> and to the Duke of
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>; and it was perfectly consistent with that which
the latter had received from Major General <span class="smcap">Dörnberg</span>, who
had been posted in observation at Mons, and from General <span class="smcap">van
Merlen</span> (through the Prince of <span class="smcap">Orange</span>) who, as already
mentioned, commanded the Outposts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> between that place and Binche.
Nothing, however, was as yet positively known concerning the real point
of concentration, the probable strength of the Enemy, or his intended
offensive movements, and the Allied Commanders therefore refrained from
making any alteration in their dispositions, and calmly awaited the
arrival of reports of a more definite character concerning the Enemy's
designs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s troops were kept under arms during the night, and
were collected by Battalions at their respective points of assembly.</p>

<p>Later in the day <span class="smcap">Zieten</span> ascertained, through his Outposts,
that strong French Columns, composed of all Arms, were assembling in
his front, and that every thing portended an attack on the following
morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s communication of this intelligence reached
<span class="smcap">Blücher</span> between nine and ten o'clock on the night of the 14th.</p>

<p>Simultaneous Orders were consequently despatched by eleven o'clock
for the march of <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s Corps from Namur upon Sombref, and
of <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s Corps from Ciney to Namur. An Order had
already, in the course of the day, been forwarded to <span class="smcap">Bülow</span> at
Liege, desiring him to make such a disposition of his <i>Corps d'Armée</i>
as should admit of its concentration at Hannut in one march; and at
midnight a further Order was despatched, requiring him to concentrate
his troops in cantonment about Hannut.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zieten</span> was directed to await the advance of the Enemy in his
position upon the Sambre; and, in the event of his being attacked by
superior numbers, and compelled to retire, to effect his retreat as
slowly as circumstances would permit, in the direction of Fleurus, so
as to afford sufficient time for the concentration of the other three
Corps in rear of the latter point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>The vigilance which was thus exercised along both the Anglo-Allied
and Prussian line of Outposts, obtained for <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> and
<span class="smcap">Blücher</span> the fullest extent of information which they could
reasonably have calculated on receiving respecting the dispositions
of the Enemy immediately previous to an attack. They had been put in
possession of the fact that considerable masses of French troops had
moved by their right, and assembled in front of Charleroi. Still,
this baring of the frontier beyond Tournai, Mons, and Binche, of the
troops which had previously occupied that line, and their concentration
in front of Charleroi, might be designed to mask the real line of
operation, to draw the Anglo-Allied troops towards Charleroi, upon
which a feigned attack would be made, while the real attack was
intended to be by Mons. Hence no alteration was made by the Duke
in the disposition of his forces; but the Prussian Field Marshal
immediately ordered the concentration of his own troops at a point
where they would be at hand in case Charleroi should be the real line
of attack, and whence they could far more readily move to the support
of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, should that attack be made by the Mons road.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s position, and his line of Advanced Posts, have
already been described. His Right Brigade (the First), having its Head
Quarters at Fontaine l'Evêque, held the ground between Binche and the
Sambre; his Centre Brigade (the Second) lay along the Sambre, occupying
Marchienne au Pont, Dampremy, La Roux, Charleroi, Châtelet, and Gilly;
a portion of his Third Brigade occupied Farciennes and Tamines on the
Sambre, while the remainder was posted in reserve between Fleurus and
the Sambre; and his Left Brigade (the Fourth) was extended along this
river nearly as far as Namur. The Reserve Cavalry of the First Corps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
had been brought more in advance, and was now cantoned in the vicinity
of the Piéton, having Gosselies for its point of concentration.</p>

<p>In this position, <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>, without making the slightest
alteration, remained fully prepared for the expected attack on the
morrow.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> was occupied in prescribing his intended
order of attack, he received a despatch from Count <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>
announcing that Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">de Bourmont</span>, and Colonels
<span class="smcap">Clouet</span> and <span class="smcap">Villoutreys</span>, attached to the Fourth Corps,
had deserted to the Enemy&mdash;a circumstance which induced the Emperor to
make some alteration in his dispositions.</p>

<p>The morning of the 15th had scarcely broken, when the French Army
commenced its march towards the Sambre, in three Columns, from the
three bivouacs already mentioned as having been taken up during the
previous night. The Left Column advanced from Solre sur Sambre, by
Thuin, upon Marchienne au Pont; the Centre from Beaumont, by Ham sur
Heure, upon Charleroi; and the Right Column from Philippeville, by
Gerpinnes, upon Châtelet.</p>

<p>As early as half past three o'clock in the morning, the head of the
Left Column came in contact with the Prussian troops in front of
Lobbes, firing upon, and driving in, the Picquets of the 2nd Battalion
of the 1st Regiment of Westphalian Landwehr, commanded by Captain
<span class="smcap">Gillhausen</span>. This Officer who was well aware that the French
troops that had assembled, the night before, in great force in his
front, intended to attack him in the morning, had posted his Battalion
so as to afford it every advantage to be derived from the hilly and
intersected ground it occupied. The French, however, inclined more to
their right, and joined other troops advancing along the road to Thuin,
which lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> on his left. Shortly after, they drove back an advanced
Cavalry Picquet; and, at half past four, commenced a fire from four
guns upon the Outpost of Maladrie, about a mile in front of Thuin.</p>

<p>This cannonade, which announced the opening of the Campaign by the
French, was heard by the Prussian troops forming the Left Wing of
<span class="smcap">Steinmetz</span>'s Brigade; but the atmosphere, which was extremely
thick and heavy, was most unfavourable for the conveyance of sound;
so much so, that the greater portion of the Right Wing of the Brigade
remained for a considerable time in ignorance of the Enemy's advance.</p>

<p>The firing, however, was distinctly heard at Charleroi; and
<span class="smcap">Zieten</span>, who, by the reports which he forwarded on the 14th
to <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> and <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, had fully prepared these
Commanders to expect an attack, lost no time in communicating to them
the important fact, that hostilities had actually commenced.</p>

<p>Shortly before five o'clock, he despatched <i>Courier Jägers</i> to their
respective Head Quarters, Brussels and Namur, with letters containing
the information that since half past four o'clock, he had heard several
cannon shots fired in his front, and at the time he was writing, the
fire of musketry also, but that he had not yet received any report
from his Outposts. To <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> he at the same time intimated
that he should direct the whole Corps to fall back into position; and,
should it become absolutely necessary, to concentrate at Fleurus. His
report to the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> arrived in Brussels at nine
o'clock in the morning; that to Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> reached Namur
between eight and nine o'clock. The former, while it placed the British
Commander on the <i>qui vive</i>, did not induce him to adopt any particular
measure&mdash;he awaited further and more definite information; but the
latter satisfied the Prussian Field Marshal that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> had taken a wise
precaution in having already ordered the concentration of his several
Corps in the position of Sombref.</p>

<p>The Prussian troops at Maladrie checked, for a time, the advance of
the French upon Thuin, and maintained their ground for more than an
hour, with the greatest bravery. They were overpowered, and driven back
upon Thuin. This place was occupied by the 3rd Battalion of the 2nd
Westphalian Landwehr, under Major <span class="smcap">Monsterberg</span>, who, after an
obstinate and gallant resistance, during which the Battalion suffered
an immense loss, was forced to retire, about seven o'clock, upon
Montigny, where he found Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Woisky</span>, with two
Squadrons of the 1st West Prussian Dragoons.</p>

<p>The French succeeded in taking this village, and the retreat was then
continued in good order, under the protection of <span class="smcap">Woisky</span>'s
Dragoons, towards Marchienne au Pont; but before reaching this place,
the latter were attacked, and completely overthrown by the French
Cavalry; and the Infantry getting into disorder at the same moment
were partly cut down, and many were taken prisoners. Indeed so severe
was the loss which the 3rd Battalion of the 2nd Westphalian Landwehr
suffered in this retreat, that the mere handful of men which remained
could not possibly be looked upon as constituting a Battalion in
the proper meaning of the term. It was reduced to a mere skeleton.
Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Woisky</span> was wounded on this occasion; but
continued, nevertheless, at the head of his Dragoons.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Gillhausen</span>, who, as before stated, commanded the
Prussian Battalion posted at Lobbes, as soon as he had satisfied
himself that Thuin was taken, saw the necessity of effecting his own
retreat, which he did, after the lapse of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> half an hour, drawing in his
Picquets, and occupying the Bridge over the Sambre with one Company.
He then fell back, and occupied the Wood of Sar de Lobbes, where he
received an Order, as soon as the Post of Hoarbes was also taken by the
Enemy, to continue his retreat, taking a direction between Fontaine
l'Evêque and Anderlues.</p>

<p>The Post at Abbaye d'Alnes, occupied by the 3rd Battalion of the
1st Westphalian Landwehr, under the temporary command of Captain
<span class="smcap">Grollmann</span>, also fell into the hands of the French, between
eight and nine o'clock.</p>

<p>As soon as the Commander of the First Prussian Brigade&mdash;General
<span class="smcap">Steinmetz</span>&mdash;was made acquainted with the attack upon his most
Advanced Posts along the Sambre, he despatched an Officer of his
Staff&mdash;Major <span class="smcap">Arnauld</span>&mdash;to the Dutch-Belgian General <span class="smcap">van
Merlen</span> at St Symphorien, situated on the road between Binche and
Mons, to make him fully acquainted with what had taken place, and
with the fact that his Brigade was falling back into position. On
his way, Major <span class="smcap">Arnauld</span> directed Major <span class="smcap">Engelhardt</span>,
who commanded the Outposts on the right, to lose not a moment in
withdrawing the chain of Picquets; and on arriving at Binche, he spread
the alarm that the French had attacked, and that the Left of the
Brigade was warmly engaged, which rendered it necessary that the Right
should retire with the utmost expedition. Until this Officer's arrival,
the Prussian troops in this quarter were wholly ignorant of the attack;
the state of the atmosphere, to which allusion has already been made,
having prevented their hearing the slightest sound of any firing. They
had a much greater extent of ground to pass over in retreat than the
rest of the Brigade, and yet, by the above unfortunate circumstance,
they were the last to retire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zieten</span>, having ascertained, about eight o'clock, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
whole French Army appeared to be in motion, and that the direction
of the advance of its Columns seemed to indicate the probability of
Charleroi and its vicinity being the main object of the attack, sent
out the necessary Orders to his Brigades. The First was to retire
by Courcelles to the position in rear of Gosselies; the Second was
to defend the three Bridges over the Sambre, at Marchienne au Pont,
Charleroi, and Châtelet, for a time sufficient to enable the First
Brigade to effect its retreat towards Gosselies, and thus to prevent
its being cut off by the Enemy, after which it was to retire behind
Gilly; the Third and Fourth Brigades, as also the Reserve Cavalry and
Artillery, were to concentrate as rapidly as possible, and to take up a
position in rear of Fleurus.</p>

<p>The three points by which the First Brigade was to fall back, were
Mont St Aldegonde, for the troops on the right, Anderlues for those
in the centre, and Fontaine l'Evêque for the left. In order that they
might reach these three points about the same time, <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>
ordered that those in front of Fontaine l'Evêque should yield their
ground as slowly as the Enemy's attack would admit. Having reached
the line of these three points, about ten o'clock, the Brigade
commenced its further retreat towards Courcelles, having its proper
Left protected by a separate Column consisting of the 1st Regiment
of Westphalian Landwehr and two Companies of Silesian Rifles, led by
Colonel <span class="smcap">Hoffmann</span>, in the direction of Roux and Jumet, towards
Gosselies.</p>

<p>At Marchienne au Pont stood the 2nd Battalion of the 6th Prussian
Regiment, belonging to the Second Brigade of <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Corps.
The Bridge was barricaded, and with the aid of two guns, resolutely
maintained against several attacks; after which these troops commenced
their retreat upon Gilly, by Dampremy. In the latter place were three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
Companies of the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of Westphalian
Landwehr, with four guns. These also retired about the same time
towards Gilly, the guns protecting the retreat by their fire from the
Churchyard; after which they moved off as rapidly as possible towards
Gilly, while the Battalion marched upon Fleurus; but the 4th Company,
which defended the Bridge of La Roux until Charleroi was taken, was too
late to rejoin the latter, and therefore attached itself to the First
Brigade, which was retreating by its Right Flank.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Lieutenant General Count <span class="smcap">Pajol</span>'s Corps of Light Cavalry formed
the Advanced Guard of the Centre Column of the French Army: it was to
have been supported by <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>'s Corps of Infantry, but by
some mistake, this General had not received his Orders, and at six
o'clock in the morning had not quitted his bivouac. <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>,
perceiving the error, led forward the Imperial Guards in immediate
support of <span class="smcap">Pajol</span>. As the latter advanced, the Prussian
Outposts, though hard pressed, retired, skirmishing in good order. At
Couillet, on the Sambre, about a mile and a half below Charleroi, the
French Cavalry fell upon a Company of the 3rd Battalion of the 28th
Prussian Regiment, surrounded it, and forced it to surrender.</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards, the French gained possession of Marcinelles,
a village quite close to Charleroi, and connected with this town by
a dike 300 paces in length, terminating at a Bridge, the head of
which was palisaded. Along this dike the French Cavalry ventured to
advance, but was suddenly driven back by the Prussian Skirmishers, who
lined the hedges and ditches intersecting the opposite slope of the
embankment; a part of the village was retaken, and an attempt made to
destroy the Bridge. The French,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> however, having renewed the attack
with increased force, succeeded in finally carrying both the dike and
the Bridge, and by this means effected their entrance into Charleroi.
Major <span class="smcap">Rohr</span>, who commanded this Post, now felt himself under
the necessity of effecting his retreat with the 1st Battalion of the
6th Prussian Regiment, towards the preconcerted position in rear of
Gilly, which he did in good order, though hotly pursued by Detachments
of <span class="smcap">Pajol</span>'s Dragoons.</p>

<p>By eleven o'clock, the French were in full possession of Charleroi, as
also of both banks of the Sambre above the town, and <span class="smcap">Reille</span>'s
Corps was effecting its passage over the river at Marchienne au Pont.</p>

<p>The right Column of the French Army, commanded by Count
<span class="smcap">Gérard</span>, having a longer distance to traverse, had not yet
reached its destined point, Châtelet on the Sambre.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Fourth Brigade of <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Corps, as also the advanced
portion of the Third, continued their retreat towards Fleurus;
General <span class="smcap">Jagow</span>, who commanded the latter, having left the
two Silesian Rifle Companies and the Fusilier Battalion<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> of the
7th Prussian Regiment at Farciennes and Tamines, for the purpose of
watching the points of passage across the Sambre, and of protecting
the Left Flank of the position at Gilly. But, from the moment the
French made themselves masters of Charleroi, and of the left bank of
the Sambre above that town, the situation of the First Brigade under
General <span class="smcap">Steinmetz</span> became extremely critical. <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>
immediately ordered General <span class="smcap">Jagow</span>, whose Brigade was in
reserve, to detach Colonel <span class="smcap">Rüchel</span> with the 29th Regiment
of Infantry to Gosselies, for the purpose of facilitating General
<span class="smcap">Steinmetz</span>'s retreat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> The Colonel found that General
<span class="smcap">Röder</span> (commanding the Reserve Cavalry of the Corps) had posted
there the 6th Regiment of Prussian Uhlans (Lancers) under Lieutenant
Colonel <span class="smcap">Lützow</span>, to whom he confided the defence of Gosselies,
which he occupied with the 2nd Battalion of the 29th Regiment, while he
placed himself in reserve with the other two Battalions.</p>

<p>As soon as the French had assembled in sufficient force at Charleroi,
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> ordered Count <span class="smcap">Pajol</span> to detach General
<span class="smcap">Clary</span>'s Brigade towards Gosselies, and to advance with the
remainder of the First Corps of Reserve Cavalry towards Gilly. General
<span class="smcap">Clary</span>, with the 1st French Hussars, reached Jumet, on the
left of the Brussels road, and only but little more than a mile from
Gosselies, before the First Prussian Brigade had crossed the Piéton.
He now advanced to attack Gosselies, but was met by Lieutenant Colonel
<span class="smcap">Lützow</span> and his Dragoons, who defeated and repulsed him, and
thus secured for General <span class="smcap">Steinmetz</span> time to pass the Piéton;
and as soon as the latter had turned the Defile of Gosselies, Colonel
<span class="smcap">Rüchel</span> with the 29th Regiment moved off to rejoin the Third
Brigade.</p>

<p>The check thus experienced by General <span class="smcap">Clary</span> led to his being
supported by Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">Lefèbvre-Desnouettes</span>, with
the Light Cavalry of the Guard and the two Batteries attached to this
force; and a Regiment from Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">Duhesme</span>'s
Division of the Young Guard was advanced midway between Charleroi and
Gosselies as a Reserve to <span class="smcap">Lefèbvre-Desnouettes</span>. The Advanced
Guard of <span class="smcap">Reille</span>'s Corps, which had crossed the Sambre at
Marchienne au Pont, was also moving directly upon Gosselies, with the
design both of cutting off the retreat of <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s troops
along the Brussels road, and of separating the Prussians from the
Anglo-Allied Army.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> <span class="smcap">D'Erlon</span>'s Corps, which was considerably in
the rear, received orders to follow and support <span class="smcap">Reille</span>.</p>

<p>General <span class="smcap">Steinmetz</span>, upon approaching Gosselies, and perceiving
the strength of the Enemy and the consequent danger of being completely
cut off, with the utmost promptitude and decision directed the 2nd
Battalion of the 1st Westphalian Landwehr to march against the Enemy's
Left Flank, with a view to divert his attention and to check his
advance, while, protected by the 6th Lancers and the 1st Silesian
Hussars, he continued his retreat towards Heppignies. This plan
was attended with complete success; and <span class="smcap">Steinmetz</span> reached
Heppignies with scarcely any loss, followed by General <span class="smcap">Girard</span>
at the head of the Seventh Division of the Second French <i>Corps
d'Armée</i>, with the remainder of which <span class="smcap">Reille</span> continued his
advance along the Brussels road. Heppignies was already occupied by the
2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 12th Prussian Regiment, and with this
increase of strength <span class="smcap">Steinmetz</span> drew up in order of battle,
and upon <span class="smcap">Girard</span>'s attempting to force the place, after having
previously occupied Ransart, he advanced against him, and drove him
back in the direction of Gosselies. A brisk cannonade ensued, which was
maintained on the part of the Prussians, only so long as it was deemed
necessary for covering their retreat upon Fleurus.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In conformity with <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Orders, General <span class="smcap">Pirch
II.</span>, when forced to abandon Charleroi, retired to Gilly, where,
having concentrated the Second Brigade, about two o'clock, he took up
a favourable position along a ridge in rear of a rivulet; his Right
resting upon the Abbey of Soleilmont, his Left extending towards
Châtelineau, which Flank was also protected by a Detachment occupying
the Bridge of Châtelet, <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>'s Corps not having as yet
arrived at that point.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> He posted the Fusilier Battalion of the 6th
Regiment in a small Wood which lay in advance on the exterior slope
of the ridge; four guns on the right, upon an eminence commanding the
valley in front; two guns between this point and the Fleurus road, as
also two guns on the right of the road, to impede as much as possible
the advance of any Columns towards Gilly. The Sharp Shooters of the
Fusilier Battalion of the 6th Regiment, by lining some adjacent
hedges, afforded protection to the Artillery. The 2nd Battalion of the
28th Regiment was stationed beyond the Fleurus road, near the Abbey
of Soleilmont, in such a manner as to be concealed from the Enemy.
The 1st Battalion of this Regiment stood across the road leading to
Lambusart; and its Fusilier Battalion was posted more to the left,
towards Châtelet. The 2nd Battalion of the 2nd Westphalian Landwehr was
posted in support of the Battery in rear of Gilly. The 1st Battalion of
this Regiment, previously mentioned as on the march from Dampremy to
Fleurus, passed through Lodelinsart and Soleilmont, and rejoined the
Brigade in rear of Gilly, before the affair had terminated. The 1st and
2nd Battalions of the 6th Regiment formed the Reserve. The 1st West
Prussian Dragoons were posted on the declivity of the ridge towards
Châtelet: they furnished the Advanced Posts, and patrolled the valley
of the Sambre, maintaining the communication with the Detachment at
Farciennes, belonging to the Third Brigade.</p>

<p>General <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>, foreseeing that in the event of the Enemy
succeeding in turning his Right, a rapid advance along the Fleurus
road would be the means of greatly molesting, if not of seriously
endangering, his retreat upon Lambusart, took the precaution of having
this road blocked up by an <i>abatis</i> in the Wood through which it led.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vandammme</span> did not reach Charleroi until three o'clock in
the afternoon, when he received Orders to pursue the Prussians, in
conjunction with <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>, along the Fleurus road. It was,
however, a considerable time before any advance was made. In the
first place, the whole of <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>'s Corps had to cross the
Sambre by a single Bridge; secondly, both Generals were deceived
by exaggerated reports concerning the strength of the Prussians in
rear of the Fleurus Woods; and <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> who had gone forward
to reconnoitre, returned to the Emperor with a request for further
instructions. Upon this, <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> undertook a reconnaissance
in person, accompanied by the four Squadrons <i>de Service</i>; and having
formed an opinion that the amount of force in question did not exceed
18, or 20,000 men, he gave his Orders for the attack of General
<span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s Brigade.</p>

<p>The French Generals having directed their preparatory dispositions
from the Windmill near the Farm of Grand Drieu, opened the engagement
about six o'clock in the evening, with a fire from two Batteries. Three
Columns of Infantry advanced in echelon from the right, the first
directing its course towards the little Wood occupied by the Fusilier
Battalion of the 6th Prussian Regiment; the second passing to the right
of Gilly; and the third winding round the left of this Village. The
attack was supported by two Brigades of General <span class="smcap">Excelmans</span>'
Cavalry Corps, namely, those of Generals <span class="smcap">Bourthe</span> and
<span class="smcap">Bonnemain</span>; of which one was directed towards Châtelet, thus
menacing the Prussian Left Flank, and the other advanced along the
Fleurus road.</p>

<p>The Battery attached to the Second Prussian Brigade was in the act
of replying with great spirit to the superior fire from the French
Artillery, and the Light Troops were already engaged, when General
<span class="smcap">Pirch</span> received <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Orders to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> avoid an action
against superior numbers, and to retire by Lambusart upon Fleurus.</p>

<p>Perceiving the formidable advance and overwhelming force of the Enemy,
he did not hesitate a moment in carrying those Orders into effect,
and made his dispositions accordingly; but the retreat had scarcely
commenced when his Battalions were vigorously assailed by the French
Cavalry. <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, in the hope of profiting by this retrograde
movement, sent against the retreating Columns the four Squadrons <i>de
Service</i> of the Guard, under General <span class="smcap">Letort</span>, a distinguished
Cavalry Officer attached to his Staff. The Prussian Infantry withstood
the repeated attacks of the French Cavalry with undaunted bravery, and
aided by the gallant exertions of Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Woisky</span>,
who boldly met the Enemy with the 1st West Prussian Dragoons, and
checked his progress, the greater part of it succeeded in gaining the
Wood of Fleurus. The Fusilier Battalion of the 28th Regiment (of which
it will be recollected, one Company had previously been captured on the
right bank of the Sambre) was the only Column broken on this occasion.
It had been ordered to retire into the Wood by Rondchamp, but before it
could complete the movement, it was overtaken by the Enemy's Cavalry,
by which it was furiously assailed, and suffered a loss of two thirds
of its number.</p>

<p>The Fusilier Battalion of the 6th Regiment was more fortunate. When
about five hundred paces from the Wood, it was attacked by the Enemy's
Cavalry on the plain, but forming Square, and reserving its fire until
the French horsemen had approached within twenty or thirty paces, it
gallantly repelled several charges. As the vigour with which these
attacks were made began to slacken, the Battalion cleared its way with
the bayonet through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> Cavalry that continued hovering round it. One
of its Companies immediately extended itself along the edge of the
wood, and kept the French Cavalry at bay. The latter suffered severely
on this occasion, and General <span class="smcap">Letort</span> who led the attacks was
mortally wounded.</p>

<p>The Brandenburg Dragoons had been detached by <span class="smcap">Zieten</span> in
support of <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s Brigade, and opportunely reaching the Field
of Action, made several charges against the French Cavalry, which they
repulsed and compelled to relinquish its pursuit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s Brigade now took up a position in front of Lambusart,
which was occupied by some Battalions of the Third Brigade, and General
<span class="smcap">Röder</span> joined it with his remaining three Regiments of Cavalry
and a Battery of Horse Artillery. At this moment, the French Cavalry,
which was formed up in position, opened a fire from three Batteries of
Horse Artillery, and thus brought on a cannonade, with which, however,
the affair terminated.</p>

<p>The First Prussian Brigade having safely executed its retreat from
Heppignies, towards Fleurus, reached St Amand about eleven o'clock at
night.</p>

<p>The Detachments left by the Third Brigade at Farciennes and Tamines,
had been previously called in, and effected their retreat without
any molestation, as did also, subsequently, the Second Brigade from
Lambusart, by Boulet, towards Fleurus, protected by the Reserve Cavalry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Corps, at three o'clock in the morning had possessed
a line of Advanced Posts, from Dinant on the Meuse, crossing the
Sambre at Thuin, and extending as far as Bonne Esperance, in advance
of Binche; thus stretching along a space of from forty to fifty miles
in length: its main force occupied the Sambre from Thuin as far as its
confluence with the Meuse, an extent of, at least, thirty six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> miles,
exclusive of the numerous windings throughout the whole course of the
river between those two points. The men had, since daybreak, been
constantly under arms, in motion, and almost as constantly engaged,
pursued, and assailed upon all points by an overwhelming superiority
of force, headed by the <i>élite</i> of the French Cavalry; and it was
not until about eleven o'clock at night that the Corps effected its
concentration in position between Ligny and St Amand, at a distance
varying from fourteen to twenty miles in rear of its original extended
line of Outposts; after having successfully and gloriously fulfilled
the arduous task imposed upon it of gaining sufficient time for the
concentration, on the following day, of all the Prussian Corps, by
stemming, as well as its scattered force would admit, the imposing
advance of the whole French Army.</p>

<p>The loss of the First Prussian <i>Corps d'Armée</i> on the 15th of June,
amounted to 1200 men. The Fusilier Battalions of the 28th Regiment
and of the 2nd Westphalian Landwehr, reduced to mere skeletons, were
united, and formed into one Battalion.</p>

<p>Before ten o'clock on the morning of the 15th, a further Order was
despatched from the Prussian Head Quarters to the Third <i>Corps
d'Armée</i>, to the effect that after resting during the night at Namur,
it was to continue its march upon the morning of the 16th, towards
Sombref.</p>

<p>At half past eleven o'clock in the forenoon a despatch was forwarded to
<span class="smcap">Bülow</span>, announcing the advance of the French, and requesting
that the Corps after having rested at Hannut, should commence its march
upon Gembloux by daybreak of the 16th, at the latest.</p>

<p>By three o'clock in the afternoon of the 15th, the Second <i>Corps
d'Armée</i> had taken up the position assigned to it between Onoz and Mazy
in the immediate vicinity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> Sombref, with the exception, however, of
the Seventh Brigade, which, having been stationed in the most remote of
the Quarters occupied by the Corps, did not reach Namur until midnight.
Here the latter found an Order for its continuance in Namur until the
arrival of the Third <i>Corps d'Armée</i>; but as this had already taken
place, the Brigade, after a few hours' rest, resumed its march, and
joined its Corps at Sombref about ten o'clock in the morning of the
16th June.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thielemann</span> passed the night at Namur, which he occupied with
the Tenth Brigade; the Ninth Brigade bivouacked on the right, and the
Eleventh on the left, of Belgrade, a village at a short distance from
the town, on the road to Sombref; the Twelfth Brigade in rear of the
Ninth; the Reserve Cavalry at Flavinne, between that road and the
Sambre; and the Reserve Artillery on the left of the road.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It has already been explained that on the 14th, <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>
sent off a despatch to <span class="smcap">Bülow</span> desiring him to make such a
disposition of his Corps as should enable his troops to reach Hannut
in one march; and that at midnight of the 14th, a second despatch was
forwarded, requiring him to concentrate the Fourth Corps at Hannut. The
first of these despatches reached <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>, at Liege, at five
o'clock on the morning of the 15th; when he issued the necessary Orders
with an instruction that they should be acted upon as soon as the
troops had dined, and forwarded a report of this arrangement to Head
Quarters. These Orders to his troops had been despatched some hours,
and the consequent movements were for the most part in operation, when,
towards noon, the second despatch arrived. <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>, considering
the effect which the change required by this new Order would have upon
the troops, inasmuch as their reception was prepared in quarters to
which, in this case,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> they would no longer proceed, and they would
have nothing provided for them in the destined bivouac near Hannut,
also as a great proportion of them could not receive the Orders for
the change in the direction of their march until evening, decided upon
deferring the new movement until daybreak of the 16th. The despatch,
moreover, did not require him to establish his Head Quarters at Hannut,
but merely suggested that the latter appeared the most suitable for
the purpose. The General was, besides, perfectly unconscious of the
commencement of hostilities, which, indeed, he had expected would be
preceded by a Declaration of War; and he had also good grounds for an
opinion which he had formed that it was in contemplation to assemble
the whole Army at Hannut.</p>

<p>He made a report to Head Quarters of his reasons for deferring the
execution of the Order, with the intimation that he would be at Hannut
by midday of the 16th. Captain <span class="smcap">Below</span>, on <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s
Staff, who carried this despatch, arrived at nine o'clock in the
evening of the 15th at Namur, where he discovered that the Head
Quarters of the Army had been transferred to Sombref.</p>

<p>At half past eleven o'clock in the forenoon of the 15th, another
despatch was forwarded to <span class="smcap">Bülow</span> from Namur, announcing the
advance of the French, and requesting that the Fourth Corps, after
having rested at Hannut, should commence its march upon Gembloux, by
daybreak of the 16th at latest. The Orderly who carried it was directed
to proceed to Hannut, the presumed Head Quarters of <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s
Corps on that day. On reaching that place, the Orderly found the
previous despatch lying in readiness for the General, and, mounting
a fresh horse, he then went on with both despatches to Liege, where
he arrived at sunrise. The Orders which they contained had now,
however, become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> impracticable, in consequence of <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s
not having immediately carried into effect the <i>first</i> Order to
collect at Hannut; and thus by one of those mischances, which, in war,
occasionally mar the best planned operations, the opportune arrival of
the Fourth Prussian Corps at the Battle of Ligny, which would, in all
probability, have changed the aspect of affairs, was rendered a matter
of impossibility.</p>

<p>Late in the evening, and after Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> had established
his Head Quarters at Sombref, Captain <span class="smcap">Below</span> arrived with the
before mentioned report from Count <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>; on receiving which
his Highness was made sensible that he could no longer calculate with
certainty upon being joined by the Fourth Corps on the following day.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was seven o'clock in the evening of the 15th, when Marshal
<span class="smcap">Ney</span>, who had just arrived, joined the Emperor near Charleroi,
at the point where the road to Fleurus branches off from the one
to Brussels. Having expressed the pleasure he felt at seeing him,
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> gave him the command of the First and Second <i>Corps
d'Armée</i>; explaining at the same time that <span class="smcap">Reille</span> was
advancing with three Divisions upon Gosselies; that <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>
would pass the night at Marchienne au Pont; that he would find under
his orders <span class="smcap">Piré</span>'s Light Cavalry Division; as also the two
Regiments of <i>Chasseurs</i> and Lancers of the Guard, of which, however,
he was not to make use except as a Reserve. "Tomorrow," added the
Emperor, "you will be joined by the Reserve Corps of Heavy Cavalry
under <span class="smcap">Kellermann</span>. Go and drive back the Enemy."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It has already been shown in the preceding Chapter, that the extreme
Left of the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Army, composed of <span class="smcap">de
Perponcher</span>'s Second Dutch-Belgian Division,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> rested upon the
Charleroi road to Brussels. The Second Brigade of this Division, under
Colonel <span class="smcap">Gödecke</span>, was thus located:&mdash;1st Battalion of the 2nd
Regiment of Nassau, at Hautain le Val; the 2nd Battalion, at Frasne
and Villers Peruin; the 3rd Battalion, at Bezy, Sart à Mavelines, and
Quatre Bras; both Battalions of the Regiment of Orange-Nassau, at
Genappe. There was also at Frasne a Dutch Battery of Horse Artillery,
under Captain <span class="smcap">Byleveld</span>.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 15th, these troops were lying quietly in
their cantonments, perfectly unconscious of the advance of the French
Army, when they heard a brisk cannonade at a distance in the direction
of Charleroi; but not having received the slightest intimation of the
Enemy's approach, they concluded that the firing proceeded from the
Prussian Artillery practice, which they had frequently heard before,
and to which they had therefore become accustomed. Gradually towards
noon, however, the cannonade became more distinctly audible; and, in
the afternoon, the arrival of a wounded Prussian soldier completely
set at rest all doubt as to the advance of the French. An Orderly
was immediately despatched with the intelligence to the Regimental
Head Quarters, whence it was also communicated to General <span class="smcap">de
Perponcher</span>'s Head Quarters at Nivelles.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Major <span class="smcap">Normann</span>, who commanded the 2nd
Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of Nassau, drew up the latter with the
Battery in position in rear of Frasne, and upon the road to Quatre
Bras, after having posted a Picquet of observation in advance of the
village.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perponcher</span> lost not a moment in ordering both Brigades of his
Division to hasten towards their respective points of assembly; the
1st Brigade, under General <span class="smcap">Bylandt</span>, to Nivelles, and the 2nd,
under Colonel <span class="smcap">Gödecke</span>, to Quatre Bras.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>Before this Order, however, could possibly reach these troops, Prince
<span class="smcap">Bernhard</span> of Saxe Weimar, who commanded the Regiment of
Orange-Nassau, at Genappe, having been informed by the Officer of the
Dutch-Belgian <i>Maréchaussées</i>, who had been compelled to quit his post
at Charleroi, that the French were advancing from that place, took upon
himself to move forward with the above Regiment from Genappe to Quatre
Bras, and despatched a report of such movement to the Head Quarters
of the Brigade at Hautain le Val, as also, subsequently, to General
<span class="smcap">de Perponcher</span> at Nivelles, by Captain <span class="smcap">Gagern</span>, of the
Dutch-Belgian Staff, who happened to be just then at Genappe, for the
purpose of collecting information.</p>

<p>About six o'clock in the evening, parties of Lancers belonging to
<span class="smcap">Piré</span>'s Light Cavalry Division of <span class="smcap">Reille</span>'s Corps
appeared in front of Frasne, and soon drove in Major <span class="smcap">Normann</span>'s
Picquet.</p>

<p>This Officer placed a Company on the south or French side of Frasne,
for the purpose of preventing as long as possible the entrance of
the French into the Village. <span class="smcap">Byleveld</span>'s Battery took post
on the north side of the Village, and the remaining Companies of the
2nd Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of Nassau drew up in its support.
Two guns were upon the road, and three on each side of it. After some
time, the Lancers, having been reinforced, compelled the Company before
mentioned to retire through the Village and fall back upon the main
body, which then opened a vigorous fire, by which this front attack by
the French Cavalry was defeated. The latter then made a disposition
to turn the Left Flank of these troops; on perceiving which Major
<span class="smcap">Normann</span> and Captain <span class="smcap">Byleveld</span> resolved upon falling
back to within a short distance in front of Quatre Bras. The retreat
was conducted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> excellent order, the Battery continuing to fire along
the high road.</p>

<p>Quatre Bras was the <i>rendezvous</i> of the Second Brigade; and the 3rd
Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of Nassau, which was cantoned in its
immediate vicinity, had already, without waiting for the receipt of
superior Orders, assembled at that point. Prince <span class="smcap">Bernhard</span>, on
arriving there with the Regiment of Orange-Nassau, and learning the
particulars of the engagement at Frasne, assumed the command as Senior
Officer, and being fully impressed with the importance of securing
the point of junction of the high road from Charleroi to Brussels,
with that from Namur to Nivelles, came to the resolution of making a
firm stand at Quatre Bras. This decision accorded entirely with the
spirit of the Orders which had in the meantime been despatched from
Braine le Comte, the Dutch-Belgian Head Quarters, on the receipt of
intelligence of the French having crossed the Sambre. General <span class="smcap">de
Perponcher</span>, who commanded the Division, had also approved of the
Prince's determination, and Colonel <span class="smcap">Gödecke</span> who was at Hautain
le Val, and who had hitherto commanded the Second Brigade, now tendered
his command to his Serene Highness, who immediately accepted it.</p>

<p>The Prince pushed forward the 3rd Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of
Nassau, in Column, upon the high road towards Frasne, detached two
Companies of the 1st Battalion, and the Volunteer <i>Jägers</i>, to the
defence of the Wood of Bossu, and the remaining Companies on the high
road towards Hautain le Val; and posted the remainder of the Brigade
at Quatre Bras, along the Namur road. Of <span class="smcap">Byleveld</span>'s Horse
Battery, four guns were posted in advance in the direction of Frasne,
two on the road to Namur, and two in rear of the main body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>By the determined show of resistance which his Serene Highness
displayed, as well as by the vigorous cannonade which he maintained,
<span class="smcap">Piré</span>'s Advanced Guard, the Left Flank of which became
endangered by the Dutch occupying the Wood of Bossu, was forced
to retire in its turn, which it did unmolested, and brought back
intelligence that Quatre Bras was occupied by ten Battalions with
Artillery, and that <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s troops were moving to
concentrate at this important point.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock at night, <span class="smcap">Ney</span>'s forces were thus
disposed:&mdash;<span class="smcap">Piré</span>'s Light Cavalry Division and
<span class="smcap">Bachelu</span>'s Infantry Division occupied Frasne, a village
situated upon the Brussels road, about two miles and a half on the
French side of Quatre Bras; the two Regiments of <i>Chasseurs</i> and
Lancers of the Guard were in reserve in rear of Frasne; <span class="smcap">Reille</span>
was with two Divisions, and the Artillery attached to them, at
Gosselies: these Divisions ensured the communication until the arrival
of <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s Corps, which was to remain that night at
Marchienne au Pont. The remaining Division of <span class="smcap">Reille</span>'s Corps
(<span class="smcap">Girard</span>'s) was at Heppignies, and thus served to maintain the
communication with the Main Column under <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>. The troops
were greatly fatigued by having been kept constantly on the march since
three o'clock in the morning; the strength of the different Regiments,
the names of their Colonels, and even of the Generals, were unknown to
the Marshal, as also the number of men that had been able to keep up
with the heads of the Columns at the end of this long march.</p>

<p>These circumstances, combined with the information brought in
from Quatre Bras, induced <span class="smcap">Ney</span> to decline risking a night
attack upon that point; and he contented himself with taking up a
position in advance of Frasne. Having issued such Orders as he deemed
essential, and enjoined the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> most vigilant look out, he returned to
Charleroi, where he arrived about midnight; partook of supper with
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> (who had just arrived from the Right Wing of the
Army), and conferred with the Emperor upon the state of affairs until
two o'clock in the morning.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The first intimation which the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> received
on the 15th, of hostilities having commenced, was conveyed in the
report already alluded to, as having been forwarded by General
<span class="smcap">Zieten</span>, shortly before five o'clock in the morning, and as
having reached Brussels at nine o'clock. It was not, however, of a
nature to enable the Duke to form an opinion as to any real attack
being contemplated by the Enemy in that quarter. It simply announced
that the Prussian Outposts in front of Charleroi were engaged. It might
be the commencement of a real attack in this direction, but it might
also be a diversion in favour of an attack in some other direction,
such as Mons. In fact, until further information was received, it could
only be considered in the light of an affair of Outposts.</p>

<p>Not long after three o'clock in the afternoon, the Prince of
<span class="smcap">Orange</span> arrived in Brussels, and informed the Duke that the
Prussian Outposts had been attacked and forced to fall back. His Royal
Highness had ridden to the front at five o'clock in the morning, from
Braine le Comte, and had a personal interview at St Symphorien, with
General <span class="smcap">van Merlen</span>, whose troops were on the immediate right
of the Prussians, who had retired. After having given to this General
Verbal Orders respecting his Brigade, the Prince left the Outposts
between nine and ten o'clock, and repaired to Brussels to communicate
to the Duke all the information he had obtained respecting the Enemy's
attack upon the Prussian Advanced Posts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>This, however, was not sufficiently conclusive to induce his Grace to
resolve upon any immediate step; but, in about an hour afterwards, that
is, about half past four, General <span class="smcap">von Müffling</span>, the Prussian
Officer attached to the British Head Quarters, waited upon the Duke
with a communication which had been despatched from Namur by Prince
<span class="smcap">Blücher</span> at noon, conveying the intelligence that the French
had attacked the Prussian Posts at Thuin and Lobbes on the Sambre,
and that they appeared to be advancing in the direction of Charleroi.
The Duke was fully prepared for this intelligence, though uncertain
how soon it might arrive. The reports which had been made to him from
the Outposts, especially from those of the 1st Hussars of the King's
German Legion, stationed in the vicinity of Mons and Tournai, gave
sufficient indication that the Enemy was concentrating his forces. But,
as observed in the preceding Chapter, his Grace was determined to make
no movement until the real line of attack should become manifest; and
hence it was, that if the attack had been made even at a later period,
his dispositions would have remained precisely the same.</p>

<p>The Duke at once gave Orders for the whole of his troops to assemble at
the Head Quarters of their respective Divisions and to hold themselves
in immediate readiness to march. At the same time an express was
despatched to Major General <span class="smcap">Dörnberg</span>, requiring information
concerning any movement that might have been made on the part of the
Enemy in the direction of Mons.</p>

<p>The following were the movements ordered by the Duke. Upon the
Left of the Army, which was nearest to the presumed point of
attack&mdash;<span class="smcap">Perponcher</span>'s and <span class="smcap">Chassé</span>'s Dutch-Belgian
Divisions were to be assembled that night at Nivelles, on which point
<span class="smcap">Alten</span>'s British Division (the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> Third) was to march as soon
as collected at Braine le Comte; but this movement was not to be
made until the Enemy's attack upon the Right of the Prussian Army
and the Left of the Allied Army had become a matter of certainty.
<span class="smcap">Cooke</span>'s British Division (the First) was to be collected that
night at Enghien, and to be in readiness to move at a moment's notice.</p>

<p>Along the central portion of the Army&mdash;<span class="smcap">Clinton</span>'s British
Division (the Second) was to be assembled that night at Ath, and to be
in readiness also to move at a moment's notice. <span class="smcap">Colville</span>'s
British Division (the Fourth) was to be collected that night at
Grammont, with the exception of the troops beyond the Scheldt, which
were to be moved to Audenarde.</p>

<p>Upon the Right of the Army&mdash;<span class="smcap">Stedmann</span>'s Dutch-Belgian Division,
and <span class="smcap">Anthing</span>'s Dutch-Belgian (Indian) Brigade were, after
occupying Audenarde with 500 men, to be assembled at Sotteghem, so as
to be ready to march in the morning.</p>

<p>The Cavalry were to be collected that night at Ninhove, with the
exception of the 2nd Hussars of the King's German Legion, who were
to remain on the look out between the Scheldt and the Lys; and of
<span class="smcap">Dörnberg</span>'s Brigade, with the Cumberland Hussars, which were to
march that night upon Vilvorde, and to bivouac on the high road near to
that town.</p>

<p>The Reserve was thus disposed&mdash;<span class="smcap">Picton</span>'s British Division (the
Fifth), the 81st British Regiment, and <span class="smcap">Best</span>'s Hanoverian
Brigade (of <span class="smcap">Cole</span>'s Division), were to be in readiness to
march from Brussels at a moment's notice. <span class="smcap">Vincke</span>'s Hanoverian
Brigade (of <span class="smcap">Picton</span>'s Division) was to be collected that night
at Hal, and to be in readiness at daylight on the following morning to
move towards Brussels, and to halt on the road between Alost and Assche
for further orders. The Duke of <span class="smcap">Brunswick</span>'s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> Corps was to be
collected that night on the high road between Brussels and Vilvorde.
<span class="smcap">Kruse</span>'s Nassau Brigade was to be collected at daylight on the
following morning upon the Louvain road, and to be in readiness to move
at a moment's notice. The Reserve Artillery was to be in readiness to
move at daylight.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was ten o'clock at night when the first intelligence of the attack
made by the French in the direction of Frasne, was received at the
Prince of <span class="smcap">Orange</span>'s Head Quarters, at Braine le Comte. It
was carried by Captain <span class="smcap">Gagern</span>, who, as previously mentioned
(see page 70), had been despatched by Prince <span class="smcap">Bernhard</span> of
Saxe Weimar, with his Serene Highness's report of the affair, to
General <span class="smcap">Perponcher</span> at Nivelles, and who was subsequently
sent on by the General, with this information to the above Head
Quarters. Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Webster</span>, Aide de Camp to the Prince
of <span class="smcap">Orange</span>, started soon afterwards for Brussels, with a
report from the Dutch-Belgian Quartermaster General, <span class="smcap">de Constant
Rebecque</span>, stating what had taken place, and detailing the measures
which he had thought proper to adopt. These measures did not entirely
coincide with the instructions above given, as issued by the Duke,
because they were consequent upon the affair at Frasne, with which his
Grace at that time was unacquainted; but they were perfectly consistent
with the spirit of those instructions, inasmuch as they were not
adopted "until the Enemy's attack upon the Right of the Prussian Army,
and the Left of the Allied Army had become a matter of certainty." The
Enemy's advance along the Charleroi road had already been successfully
checked at Quatre Bras, and the necessity of immediately collecting at
this important point, the troops ordered by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> Duke "to be assembled
that night at Nivelles" was too obvious to be mistaken.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A little before ten o'clock on the same evening, a further
communication reached the Duke from Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>,
announcing the crossing of the Sambre by the French Army, headed by
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> in person; and the required intelligence from other
quarters having arrived almost at the same moment, and confirmed him
in the opinion "that the Enemy's movement upon Charleroi was the
real attack," he issued, at ten o'clock <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, the following
Orders for the march of his troops to their Left:&mdash;<span class="smcap">Alten</span>'s
Division to continue its movement from Braine le Comte upon Nivelles.
<span class="smcap">Cooke</span>'s Division to move from Enghien upon Braine le Comte.
<span class="smcap">Clinton</span>'s and <span class="smcap">Colville</span>'s Divisions to move from Ath,
Grammont, and Audenarde, upon Enghien. The Cavalry to continue its
movement from Ninhove upon Enghien.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The disposition of the French Left Column, under <span class="smcap">Ney</span>, during
the night of the 15th, has already been shown. The Centre Column of
the French Army was thus located&mdash;<span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>'s Corps bivouacked
in the Wood of Fleurus; <span class="smcap">Pajol</span>'s Corps of Light Cavalry at
Lambusart; the Third Light Cavalry Division, under <span class="smcap">Domon</span>, on
the left, at the outlet of the Wood, and the Heavy Cavalry Corps of
<span class="smcap">Excelmans</span> between the Light Cavalry and <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>; the
Guards bivouacked between Charleroi and Gilly; and <span class="smcap">Lobau</span>'s
Corps, together with <span class="smcap">Milhaud</span>'s Heavy Cavalry Corps, lay in
rear of Charleroi. The Right Column, consisting of <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>'s
Corps, bivouacked in front of the Bridge of Châtelet, which point it
had reached during the evening.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The result of the proceedings on the 15th was highly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> favourable to
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>. He had completely effected the passage of the
Sambre; he was operating with the main portion of his forces directly
upon the preconcerted point of concentration of <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s
Army, and was already in the immediate front of the chosen position,
before that concentration could be accomplished; he was also operating
with another portion upon the high road to Brussels, and had come in
contact with the Left of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s troops; he had also
placed himself so far in advance upon this line, that even a partial
junction of the forces of the Allied Commanders was already rendered
a hazardous operation, without a previous retrograde movement; and he
thus had it in his power to bring the principal weight of his arms
against the one, whilst, with the remainder of his force, he held the
other at bay. This formed the grand object of his operations on the
morrow.</p>

<p>But however excellent, or even perfect, this plan of operation may
appear in theory, still there were other circumstances, which, if taken
into consideration, would scarcely seem to warrant a well grounded
anticipation of a successful issue. <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s troops had
been constantly under arms, marching, and fighting, since two o'clock
in the morning, the hour at which they broke up from their position
at Solre sur Sambre, Beaumont, and Philippeville, within the French
frontier: they required time for rest and refreshment; they lay widely
scattered between their Advanced Posts and the Sambre; <span class="smcap">Ney</span>'s
forces were in detached bodies from Frasne as far as Marchienne au
Pont, the halting place of <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s Corps; and although
<span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>'s Corps was in the Wood of Fleurus, <span class="smcap">Lobau</span>'s
Corps and the Guards were halted at Charleroi, and <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>'s
Corps at Châtelet. Hence, instead of an imposing advance, with the
first glimmering of the dawn of the 16th, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> whole morning would
necessarily be employed by the French in effecting a closer junction of
their forces, and in making their preparatory dispositions for attack;
an interval of time invaluable to the Allies, by the greater facility
which it afforded them for the concentration of a sufficient force to
hold their Enemy in check, and to frustrate his design of defeating
them in detail.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In taking a calm retrospect of the dispositions made by
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> on the night of the 15th of June, we become strongly
impressed with a conviction, that to the laxity of those dispositions,
to the absence which they indicated of that energetic perseverance
and restless activity which characterised the most critical of his
operations in former Wars, may, in a very great degree, be attributed
the failure of the Campaign on the part of the French. The great
advantages derived by <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> from the result of his
operations during the 15th, have been already set forth; but of what
avail were those advantages to him, if he neglected the requisite
measures for effectually retaining them within his grasp; or if, having
secured them, he hesitated in following them up with the promptitude
and energy which their complete development demanded of him? His
position, if judged by that of his most advanced forces, was all
that could be desired; but, by fatally neglecting to concentrate the
remainder of his troops in the immediate support of that advance, the
important advantages which such a position held forth were completely
neutralized. Doubtless the troops required rest; but, if one portion
required it more than another, it was that which now lay most in
advance: they had performed the longest march, and had withstood,
in addition, the whole brunt of the action; so there was no reason
whatever why the remainder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> of the French Army should not have been
so far advanced as to afford direct support to the important position
taken up by the leading Divisions: that which had been so successfully
effected by the heads of the Columns, might have been attained with
infinitely greater ease and security by the masses which followed.
And even supposing that serious impediments stood in the way of the
full accomplishment of this concentration, such as the usual delays
occasioned by the lengthening out of the Columns of March, to what did
they amount in comparison with so many brilliant instances of what had
been overcome by the noble and heroic efforts of a French Army headed
by <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>? Had it even required some sacrifice, which at
the most could only have consisted in the temporary diminution of
strength, by the loss of stragglers on the march, what was this when
placed in the balance with the fulfilment of the grand design of
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s invasion of Belgium&mdash;preventing the junction of the
Allied Armies, and overthrowing them in detail?</p>

<p>The commencement of this design, in which the essential requisite was
rapidity of movement, had been eminently successful: a vantage ground
had been gained which offered the most encouraging prospect of success:
of <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s four Corps, only one, <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s, had
assembled in the chosen position of Ligny, on the night of the 15th;
<span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s, which had arrived from Namur, was in bivouac between
Onoz and Mazy, about six miles from Ligny; <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s Corps,
which had quitted its cantonments around Ciney at half past seven
o'clock in the morning, passed the night at Namur, about fifteen miles
from Ligny; <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Corps, supposed by <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> to
be then at Hannut, was still at Liege, about sixty miles distant from
Ligny. Between this position of Ligny and that occupied by the leading
Divisions of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s main Army, namely the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> villages of
Lambusart, Wagnée, and the Wood of Fleurus, there was an interval of
not more than from two to three miles! Hence every thing was favourable
to the French Emperor's plan, which only required to be carried on with
the same vigour and activity that had marked its commencement; the fate
of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, of France, and of Europe, hung upon its issue;
not an hour, not a moment should have been suffered to pass unheeded;
and had the French Right been concentrated during the night in this
position, as also the Left under <span class="smcap">Ney</span>, between Gosselies and
Frasne, and had an impetuous attack, with overwhelming force, been
made not later than five o'clock on the following morning, upon both
<span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s and <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s Corps, not at that time united,
it is very possible that these troops would have been beaten in detail,
that <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s Corps, advancing from Namur, would either
have shared the same fate, or have moved off in the direction of Hannut
or Liege to effect a junction with <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>, whilst <span class="smcap">Ney</span>
would either have been enabled to secure the important point of Quatre
Bras before the arrival of any considerable portion of the Anglo-Allied
troops, or would have held his own force advantageously disposed for a
junction with that of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, on the latter moving to the
left, by the Namur road, for the purpose of bringing the great mass of
his Army against <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>.</p>

<p>Instead of this, what happened? Of the French Right, its main force
remained the whole night at Charleroi and Châtelet, on the Sambre,
whilst between the Advance of <span class="smcap">Ney</span>'s forces at Frasne and
his Rear at Marchienne au Pont, there was an interval of about
twelve miles. <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> did not advance towards Fleurus
until between eleven and twelve o'clock on the 16th, by which time
<span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s, <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s, and <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s Corps
were all concentrated and in position, and he did not commence the
Battle of Ligny until nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> three o'clock in the afternoon; while
<span class="smcap">Ney</span>, on his side, in consequence of his operations having been
rendered subordinate to those of the Emperor, delayed to advance with
any degree of vigour until between two and three o'clock, about which
time <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Reserve reached Quatre Bras, from Brussels,
and joined the forces then engaged in front of that point!</p>

<p class="drop">WITH the early dawn of the 16th of June, the whole of the Duke of
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s forces were in movement towards Nivelles and
Quatre Bras. Previously to starting from Brussels for the latter
point, his Grace despatched an Order for the movement of the Cavalry
and of <span class="smcap">Clinton</span>'s British Division upon Braine le Comte, as
also of the troops under Prince <span class="smcap">Frederick</span> of the Netherlands,
consisting of <span class="smcap">Stedmann</span>'s Dutch-Belgian Division, and of
<span class="smcap">Anthing</span>'s Dutch-Belgian (Indian) Brigade, from Sotteghem to
Enghien, after leaving 500 men, as before directed, in Audenarde.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Picton</span>'s Division quitted Brussels by the Charleroi road
about two o'clock in the morning; and the Duke of <span class="smcap">Brunswick</span>'s
Corps somewhat later. <span class="smcap">Kruse</span>'s Nassau Brigade received Orders
to follow along the same road, but having been dispersed in extended
cantonments between Brussels and Louvain, it required some considerable
time to collect together, and did not therefore reach Quatre Bras
sufficiently early to take part in the action.</p>

<p>The disposition made by Colonel the Prince <span class="smcap">Bernhard</span> of Saxe
Weimar at this point, on the night of the 15th, with the Second
Brigade of <span class="smcap">Perponcher</span>'s Dutch-Belgian Division, has already
been described. Soon after ten o'clock on that evening, Major
Count <span class="smcap">Limburg Stirum</span>, Dutch Aide de Camp to the Prince of
<span class="smcap">Orange</span>, left Braine le Comte for Nivelles, with a Verbal
Order from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> Dutch-Belgian Quartermaster General, enjoining General
<span class="smcap">Perponcher</span> to hold his ground to the last extremity, to
support his Second Brigade by the First, and even to ask for aid from
the Third Anglo-Allied Division, and from the Dutch-Belgian Cavalry
Division; and, at all events, to send an Officer to acquaint the
Commanders of these Divisions with the state of affairs. This message
appears to have reached Nivelles about midnight.</p>

<p>Previously to this, that is, between nine and ten o'clock in the
evening, Captain <span class="smcap">Crassier</span>'s Company of the 27th Battalion
of <i>Chasseurs</i> moved out from Nivelles towards Quatre Bras <i>en
reconnaissance</i>. About two o'clock in the morning, <span class="smcap">Perponcher</span>
himself followed with the remainder of the <i>Chasseurs</i>, which body
reached Quatre Bras at four o'clock. General <span class="smcap">Bylandt</span>, who
commanded the First Brigade, ordered the remaining Battalions of the
latter, and his Artillery, to commence their march from Nivelles at
five o'clock. The 7th Dutch Line Battalion was directed to remain at
Nivelles until relieved by <span class="smcap">Alten</span>'s Division.</p>

<p>At three o'clock in the morning, <span class="smcap">Perponcher</span> arrived at Quatre
Bras, and after having reconnoitred the position, immediately commenced
operations for recovering the ground lost on the previous evening.
Just at this time a detachment of about fifty Prussian Hussars of the
2nd Silesian Regiment, under Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Zehelin</span>, who, on
the previous day, had been driven back from near Gosselies, and had
retreated towards Hautain le Val, gallantly advanced to the front,
attacked the Enemy's Outposts, forced them to retire, and then formed a
chain of Vedettes. As soon as the Dutch-Belgian troops had advanced to
within a short distance of these Prussian Hussars, the latter moved off
by their left towards Sombref.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>Prince <span class="smcap">Bernhard</span> of Saxe Weimar's Brigade penetrated deeper
into the Wood of Bossu, and secured the entrances into it from the
French side.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perponcher</span> directed the 2nd Battalion of the 2nd Regiment
of Nassau to take post on an eminence in advance towards Frasne,
and stationed the 3rd Battalion of this Regiment more to the left.
The latter, however, was soon relieved by the 27th Chasseurs, which
Battalion, on reaching Quatre Bras, at four o'clock in the morning, had
detached two Companies to the left. These moved steadily forward in
extended order towards the Wood of Delhutte, outside of which the Enemy
showed his Light Troops. They succeeded in forcing back the French into
a hollow way bordering the Wood, where the latter maintained themselves
for some little time, and then retired into the Wood itself. Taking
advantage of the cover afforded by the edge of the Wood, the French
now poured a deadly fire upon their assailants, who retreated to some
favourable ground a little in advance of their Battalion.</p>

<p>The Prince of <span class="smcap">Orange</span> arrived at Quatre Bras about six o'clock,
and immediately reconnoitred the position of the Enemy, and that
occupied by his own troops. Having expressed his perfect satisfaction
with all the arrangements and dispositions which had been made, both
on the previous evening and on that morning, he ordered the troops
then present to take up a position more in advance, for the purpose of
imposing upon the Enemy; enjoining at the same time, all unnecessary
firing, it being desirable under then existing circumstances, to avoid
bringing on prematurely an attack by the Enemy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Ney</span>, having quitted Charleroi at a very early hour in
the morning, returned to Gosselies, where he communicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> with
<span class="smcap">Reille</span>, whom he ordered to assemble the force then with him,
consisting of two Infantry Divisions and their Artillery, and to
advance upon Frasne: to which point the Marshal repaired in person.
Here he collected all the information which the Generals and other
Officers had been able to obtain respecting the Enemy; and being
naturally anxious to make himself acquainted with the details of
the force placed so suddenly under his orders, he desired Colonel
<span class="smcap">Heymès</span>, his first Aide de Camp, to repair to every Regiment,
and note down their strength and the names of the Commanding Officers;
after the performance of which duty, Colonel <span class="smcap">Heymès</span> laid
before the Marshal a return of the troops in the Field.</p>

<p>The uncertainty in which <span class="smcap">Ney</span> was placed as to the amount of
force concentrated by the Allies during the night in rear of Quatre
Bras, and the conviction which he had reason to entertain that the
Prussians were in strong force at no very great distance on his
right, and that therefore any check experienced by the Main Column
under <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, would endanger his Right Flank and even his
line of communication, rendered him cautious in attacking a point so
considerably in advance of the Emperor's Left, without ample means at
hand to enable him, in case of disaster, to maintain that line, or,
in the event of success, to effectually establish himself at Quatre
Bras, and derive every possible advantage from its possession, by
checking, if not defeating in detail, any body of troops that might
be approaching it as a point of concentration from either Nivelles or
Brussels.</p>

<p>Hence he became extremely anxious for the arrival of
<span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s Corps and the promised Third Corps of Heavy
Cavalry under <span class="smcap">Kellermann</span>; the more so, as although
<span class="smcap">Lefèbvre-Desnouette</span>'s Light Cavalry of the Guard was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> nearer
at hand, he had been desired by <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> not to make use
of it. Officers of the <i>Chasseurs</i> and Lancers of the Guard (in
consequence of the deficiency of Staff Officers) were sent to the rear
in the direction of Marchienne au Pont, with Orders to hasten the march
of the First Corps upon Frasne; while <span class="smcap">Ney</span> himself was busily
occupied in reconnoitring the Enemy's position and movements.</p>

<p>Whilst so employed, a despatch reached him from the Emperor,
acquainting him that he had just ordered <span class="smcap">Kellermann</span>'s Dragoons
to march to Gosselies, where they would be at his disposal; stating, at
the same time, his intention to withdraw <span class="smcap">Lefèbvre-Desnouette</span>'s
Light Cavalry of the Guard from the force under his command; and
expressing a wish to be informed of the exact disposition of the First
and Second Corps, and of the Cavalry Divisions attached to them, as
also of the probable strength of the Enemy, and of the particulars
which had been obtained concerning him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The 5th Battalion of Dutch Militia, which arrived at Quatre Bras about
seven o'clock, was ordered, some time afterwards, to occupy the Farm
of Gemioncourt. The other Battalions of <span class="smcap">Bylandt</span>'s Brigade, as
they arrived in succession, formed a Reserve, extending itself from
the point of intersection of the two high roads along the Nivelles
road, and in rear of the Wood of Bossu. About nine o'clock, Captain
<span class="smcap">Stievenaar</span>'s Foot Battery attached to <span class="smcap">Bylandt</span>'s
Brigade also arrived at Quatre Bras.</p>

<p>Aided by these reinforcements, the Prince of <span class="smcap">Orange</span> made his
dispositions for impeding as much as possible the expected French
attack, and maintaining his ground in front of Quatre Bras until the
arrival of the Allied troops, which he knew were rapidly approaching
from Brussels and Nivelles. The arrival of the First Brigade induced
him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> make a further advance, and extension to the right, of the
Second Brigade; retaining a firm hold of the Wood of Bossu.</p>

<p>He disposed of his Artillery in the following manner: upon the high
road, in advance of his Centre and in front of Frasne, he placed two
guns of <span class="smcap">Perponcher</span>'s Divisional Horse Artillery; three guns
a little in left rear of these, and three guns towards the left, so
as to keep the road to Namur in view. He also placed six guns of the
Divisional Foot Artillery a little to the right of, and in line with,
the advanced guns of the Horse Battery, and the remaining two guns on
the Right Wing of his First Line.</p>

<p>His Royal Highness had unfortunately no Cavalry in the Field; yet such
was the firm countenance which he displayed in the arrangement of
his nine Battalions and sixteen guns that the Enemy, unaware of this
circumstance, and probably misled by the appearance, at an early hour,
of the chain of Vedettes formed by the Prussian Detachment of Hussars,
to which allusion has previously been made, and also conceiving that
a considerable force had already assembled at Quatre Bras, made no
vigorous attempt, until the afternoon, to dislodge him from his
position.</p>

<p>Between ten and eleven o'clock, the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>
arrived in person at Quatre Bras, where he joined the Prince of
<span class="smcap">Orange</span>, of whose dispositions he fully approved. He
reconnoitred the ground; observed only a few of the Enemy in front,
who occasionally fired a shot; saw that there was a little popping
musketry, but that nothing more serious was at that time threatened in
this quarter.</p>

<p>Conceiving that the Enemy was not in any great force at Frasne, while
at the same time, accounts reached him that Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>,
in his position at Ligny, was menaced by the advance of considerable
masses; the Duke, accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> by his Staff and a small escort of
Cavalry, shortly afterwards rode off to hold a conference with the
Prussian Commander, whom he found at the Windmill of Bussy, between
Ligny and Bry; whence he had an opportunity of observing the French
preparatory dispositions for attack.</p>

<p>These having led the Duke to conclude that <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> was
bringing the main force of his Army to bear against <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>,
he at once proposed to assist the Prince by first advancing straight
upon Frasne and Gosselies, as soon as he should have concentrated
sufficient force, and then operating upon the Enemy's Left and Rear,
which would afford a powerful diversion in favour of the Prussians,
from the circumstance that their Right Wing was the weakest and most
exposed, and considering the object of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s movement,
the one most likely to be attacked.</p>

<p>Upon a calculation being made, however, of the time which would
elapse ere the Duke would be able to collect the requisite
force for undertaking this operation, and of the possibility of
<span class="smcap">Blücher</span> being defeated before it could be carried into effect,
it was considered preferable that <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> should, if
practicable, move to the support of the Prussian Right by the Namur
road. But a direct support of this kind was necessarily contingent
on circumstances, and subject to the Duke's discretion. The latter
having expressed his confident expectation of being enabled to afford
the desired support, as also of his succeeding in concentrating, very
shortly, a sufficient force to assume the offensive, rode back to
Quatre Bras.</p>

<p>This letter, which was intended to convey to <span class="smcap">Ney</span> a general
notion of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s intentions, prescribed to him, at the
same time, as a principle, that he was to consider his movements
subordinate to those of the Emperor. The latter intimated his purpose
of attacking the Enemy at Fleurus, should he find him there, and of
pushing on as far as Gembloux, where he would decide upon his plan of
further operation, "perhaps at three o'clock in the afternoon, perhaps
in the evening;" immediately <i>after</i> which <span class="smcap">Ney</span> was to be ready
to march upon Brussels, supported by <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> with the Guards,
it being the Emperor's desire to reach that capital in the morning.</p>

<p>The idea of advancing upon Gembloux, and of capturing Brussels
by a <i>coup de main</i>, which could only be effected by a vigorous
repulse and signal defeat of the Corps of <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>, and by a
successful turning and partial dispersion of those of <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>
and <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>, as also by the rapid march of a closely
collected force under <span class="smcap">Ney</span>, proves that <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> had
either been insufficiently informed as to the general dispositions
of his opponents, or had greatly miscalculated the degree of energy
and promptitude required in his movements for the execution of such a
design.</p>

<p>Very shortly afterwards, <span class="smcap">Ney</span> received the official Order of
Movement to which <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> adverted in his letter as having
been sent by <span class="smcap">Soult</span>. It instructed him to put the Second and
First <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, as also the Third Corps of Cavalry which had
been placed at his disposal, in movement upon Quatre Bras; to take
up a position at that point; thence to push forward reconnaissances
as far as possible on the roads to Brussels and Nivelles, <i>d'où
probablement l'Ennemi s'est retiré</i>; to establish, should he meet with
no impediment, a Division with some Cavalry at Genappe; and to detach
another Division towards Marbais, in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> cover the interval
between Sombref and Quatre Bras. He was also to desire the General
Officers commanding the two <i>Corps d'Armée</i> to assemble their troops,
collect the stragglers, and order up all the waggons belonging to the
Artillery and to the Hospitals that might still be in the rear.</p>

<p>In pursuance of these instructions, <span class="smcap">Ney</span> despatched Orders of
Movement to Counts <span class="smcap">Reille</span> and <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>.</p>

<p>The former was desired to put the Second Corps immediately on the
march, for the purpose of taking up the following position:&mdash;the Fifth
Division in rear of Genappe, upon the Heights which command that
town, the left <i>appuied</i> upon the high road; one or two Battalions
covering all the <i>débouchés</i> in advance on the Brussels road; the Ninth
Division, following the movement of the Fifth, to take up a position
in second line on the Heights to the right and left of the village of
Bauterlet; the Sixth and Seventh Divisions at Quatre Bras.</p>

<p>It was at the same time intimated to <span class="smcap">Reille</span> that the three
first Divisions of <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s Corps were to take post at
Frasne; the Right Division to establish itself at Marbais along with
<span class="smcap">Piré</span>'s Division of Light Cavalry; that the former was to cover
his (<span class="smcap">Reille</span>'s) march towards Brussels, and both his Flanks;
that two Divisions of <span class="smcap">Kellermann</span>'s Corps were to take post
at Frasne and Liberchies; and that the Regiments of the Guard under
Generals <span class="smcap">Lefèbvre-Desnouettes</span> and <span class="smcap">Colbert</span> were to
remain in their actual position at Frasne.</p>

<p>This Order had scarcely been sent off to <span class="smcap">Reille</span> when
<span class="smcap">Ney</span> received from the latter a despatch, dated Gosselies, 16th
June, a quarter past ten <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, announcing his having just
received from <span class="smcap">Girard</span> (whose Division was still at Heppignies)
a verbal report by one of his Officers, to the effect that the Enemy
continued to occupy Fleurus with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> Light Cavalry; that hostile masses
were observed advancing along the Namur road, the heads of their
Columns reaching as far as St Amand; that these troops were gradually
forming, and gaining ground; that as far as could be judged at that
distance, the Columns appeared to consist of six Battalions each; and
that movements of additional troops were perceived in their rear.
<span class="smcap">Reille</span> added that General <span class="smcap">Flahaut</span>, in passing through
Gosselies, had made him acquainted with the purport of the Orders he
was conveying to the Marshal, whereupon he had communicated with Count
<span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>, in order that the latter might follow the movement
which he (<span class="smcap">Reille</span>) had intended to commence as soon as the
Divisions were under arms, but that in consequence of this report from
<span class="smcap">Girard</span> he would wait for the Marshal's further instructions,
holding the troops ready to march.</p>

<p>About the same time, Orders reached <span class="smcap">Ney</span> from
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, desiring him to unite the Corps under
<span class="smcap">Reille</span> and <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>, and the Cavalry Corps under
<span class="smcap">Kellermann</span>, which latter, it was stated, was on the point
of commencing its march towards him; remarking also, that with these
troops he ought to be able to destroy whatever forces the Enemy might
bring forward; that <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> was going to advance upon Sombref;
and that the Emperor was setting off for Fleurus, to which place the
Marshal was to address his reports.</p>

<p class="figcenter" ><img src="images/illus09.jpg"  alt="cap"/>
<a id="illus09" name="illus09"></a></p>
<p class="caption">Quatre Bras</p>



<p>In consequence of these instructions, <span class="smcap">Ney</span> became anxious
for the speedy concentration of his troops, and again sent Orders to
<span class="smcap">Reille</span> and <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span> to move up their Divisions. The
information which he had obtained concerning the Enemy in his front,
and <span class="smcap">Girard</span>'s report of the assembling of troops in front of
Fleurus, induced him to be cautious in his proceedings, and not to
attempt any impetuous onset until he could have all his force more in
hand, instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> the greater portion of it being, as it then was,
lengthened out in Columns of Route along the Charleroi high road;
and, in this respect, his views were in perfect accordance with the
last despatch which he had received from the Emperor, enjoining him
in the first instance, to unite the two Corps of <span class="smcap">Reille</span> and
<span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>. Hence, in debouching from his position at Frasne,
about one o'clock, his advance was by no means vigorous: it was limited
to a gradual pressing forward of the Light Troops, and amounted to
little more than a reconnaissance.</p>

<p>About two o'clock, <span class="smcap">Ney</span>, calculating that <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s
Corps could not be far in his rear, and hoping that the sound of his
cannonade would hasten its march, resolved to attack the Enemy's
forces which intercepted his advance upon Quatre Bras. <span class="smcap">Piré</span>'s
Light Cavalry, constituting a strong line of Skirmishers with well
disposed Supports, covered the advance of the Infantry Divisions of
<span class="smcap">Bachelu</span> and <span class="smcap">Foy</span>, whilst that of <span class="smcap">Jerome</span>
followed as a Reserve.</p>

<p>The force with which <span class="smcap">Ney</span> thus entered the field, consisted of
Three Divisions of <span class="smcap">Reille</span>'s Corps, of <span class="smcap">Piré</span>'s Light
Cavalry, of 4 Batteries of Foot, and 1 of Horse, Artillery: altogether&mdash;</p>

<p>It was not long after two o'clock when the Duke of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>
returned to Quatre Bras from the Prussian Army. He observed
attentively, with his glass, the movements of the French, and told the
Prince of <span class="smcap">Orange</span> he would be attacked directly.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, the French advanced, and the Dutch-Belgian troops
gradually retired; but the Prince, aware of the great advantages which
the position of Quatre Bras would derive from the possession of the
Farm of Gemioncourt, adjoining the Charleroi road, as also of the
Wood of Bossu on the Right, and of the inclosures of Piermont on the
Left Flank, endeavoured, with that view, to make a stand, as soon as
his Centre reached the first named point. The 5th Battalion of Dutch
Militia which occupied this Post, successfully withstood several
attacks, during which <span class="smcap">Ney</span> drew up his forces along the ridge
which, intersecting the high road in the immediate (French) rear of
Gemioncourt, extends on one side towards the Wood of Bossu, and on the
other in the direction of Piermont.</p>

<p>The vast preponderance of force on the part of the French, was now
quite manifest to the Prince of <span class="smcap">Orange</span>, who found himself
compelled to withdraw the main body of his troops into the Wood of
Bossu, still retaining, however, the Post of Gemioncourt. He gave an
Order to Captain <span class="smcap">Stievenaar</span>'s Foot Battery to fall back and
take up a flanking position near the Wood. Here this Officer, who
possessed the highest merit, lost not a moment in reopening his fire,
but scarcely had he done so when he was mortally wounded. At the same
moment one gun was damaged so as to become useless. The Enemy rapidly
advanced in such superior force as to compel the Battery to resume
its retreat. Captain <span class="smcap">Byleveld</span>'s Horse Battery retired by the
opposite side of Gemioncourt. One of its limbers blew up, severely
wounding an Officer, and occasioning the gun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> attached to it to be
relinquished. The French pressed forward with their Light Troops;
and part of <span class="smcap">Piré</span>'s Light Cavalry, seizing a favourable
opportunity, gallantly charged the 27th Dutch Light Infantry, threw
it into confusion, and made many prisoners. At this time a portion of
<span class="smcap">Bachelu</span>'s Infantry Division on the right advanced towards the
village of Piermont.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was about half past two, or perhaps a quarter before three o'clock,
when the Prince of <span class="smcap">Orange</span>, whose situation had become
extremely critical, as he directed his anxious looks towards that point
of the horizon which was bounded by the elevated ground about Quatre
Bras, had the inexpressible satisfaction of recognising, by their deep
red masses, the arrival of British troops upon the field.</p>

<p>These comprised the Fifth Infantry Division, commanded by Lieutenant
General Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Picton</span>, and consisting of the Eighth
British Brigade, under Major General Sir <span class="smcap">James Kempt</span>, the
Ninth British Brigade, under Major General Sir <span class="smcap">Denis Pack</span>,
and of the Fourth Hanoverian Brigade, under Colonel <span class="smcap">Best</span>.
The head of the Column, leaving Quatre Bras on its right, turned down
the Namur road, along which the Division was speedily drawn up; the
British Brigades in Front, and the Hanoverian Brigade in Second Line.
Captain <span class="smcap">Rettberg</span>'s Battery of Hanoverian Foot Artillery took
post on the right, and Major <span class="smcap">Rogers</span>'s Battery of British Foot
Artillery on the left, of the Division. The 1st Battalion of the 95th
British Regiment, commanded by Colonel Sir <span class="smcap">Andrew Barnard</span>, was
despatched in haste towards the Village of Piermont, of which it was to
endeavour to gain possession.</p>

<p class="figcenter" ><img src="images/illus10.jpg" alt="cap" />
<a id="illus10" name="illus10"></a> </p>
<p class="caption">Prince of Orange</p>

<p>The French, on perceiving the arrival of the British Infantry, opened
a furious cannonade from their Batteries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> with a view to disturb its
formation, while <span class="smcap">Ney</span>, anxious to secure the vantage ground of
a Field which he plainly foresaw, was likely to become the scene of
a severe contest, renewed his attack upon Gemioncourt, still bravely
defended by the 5th Dutch Militia. Hereupon, <span class="smcap">Perponcher</span>,
having received an Order to advance this Battalion along the high
road, immediately placed himself at its head, as did also the Prince
of <span class="smcap">Orange</span> himself, who rode up to it at the same moment. The
manner in which His Royal Highness personally led on his National
Militia on this occasion, was distinguished by the most resolute
and conspicuous gallantry. The Battalion was exposed to a most
destructive fire from some guns which the Prince seemed determined to
capture. Placing himself frequently at its head, and waving his hat,
he presented in his own person so brilliant and heroic an example,
that for a considerable time the Battalion maintained its ground most
bravely against the far superior number of the Enemy. It was composed,
however, of young and inexperienced soldiers, who had not attained
sufficient confidence to fight in anything like deployed order; and,
therefore, when, a few minutes afterwards, a swarm of Cavalry rushed
upon it, it soon lost its compactness, and broke into a confused and
hasty retreat; whilst the French Infantry succeeded in obtaining
possession of the Farm, in which they firmly established themselves.</p>

<p>The Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, who now assumed the command, was
so much alive to the importance of maintaining Gemioncourt and its
inclosures, that he gave directions for its immediate occupation by
a British Regiment, but the one destined for this service having by
some accident been otherwise disposed of, some delay occurred, and the
28th British Regiment, commanded by Colonel Sir <span class="smcap">Charles Philip
Belson</span>, was then marched down towards that point,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> under the
guidance of Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Gomm</span>, on the Staff of the
Fifth Division. As the Battalion approached the Farm, the latter was
discovered to be already occupied by the French, whereupon it was
withdrawn to its Division.</p>

<p>The Third Dutch-Belgian Light Cavalry Brigade, under General
<span class="smcap">van Merlen</span>, had shortly before this reached the Field, and
now advanced to the support of the Dutch Infantry retiring from
Gemioncourt; but they were met and defeated by <span class="smcap">Piré</span>'s Cavalry,
and pursued along the high road nearly to Quatre Bras, where they
arrived in great disorder; a portion of them coming in contact with
the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> himself, and carrying his Grace along
with them to the rear of Quatre Bras. The latter, however, succeeded
in arresting their further flight, and in bringing them again to the
front. The French Cavalry did not, on this occasion, follow up the
pursuit, evidently hesitating to approach very near to the Allied
Infantry, the latter appearing well formed, and fully prepared to
receive them. The Dutch-Belgian Infantry retreated to the Wood of
Bossu, abandoning four guns to the Enemy, who closely pursued them, and
now began to penetrate into the Wood.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <span class="smcap">Bachelu</span>, on the French Right, threw a considerable
force into Piermont in sufficient time to secure its possession before
the 1st Battalion 95th British Regiment had approached the Village, and
was pushing forward another strong body towards a small Wood that lay
still more in advance, on the opposite side of the Namur high road, the
possession of which along with that of Piermont would have effectually
cut off the direct communication between Quatre Bras and Ligny. Here,
for the first time in this Campaign, the troops of the two nations
became engaged. The Skirmishers who successfully checked the further
advance of the French, and secured the Wood, were the 1st Battalion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> of
the British 95th Rifles, whom the old Campaigners of the French Army,
at least those who had served in the Peninsula, had so frequently found
the foremost in the fight, and of whose peculiarly effective discipline
and admirable training they had had ample experience.</p>

<p>The possession of Gemioncourt proved of the utmost importance to
<span class="smcap">Ney</span>'s position, which now assumed a definite character, and,
in a purely tactical point of view, offered great advantages. The
southern portion of the Wood of Bossu was occupied by his extreme
Left, while his extreme Right was in full possession of Piermont; and
these points were connected by a narrow valley extending along his
whole front, bounded on either side by a hedgerow, and intersecting
the Charleroi road close to Gemioncourt. The outer fence was strongly
occupied by his Light Troops, ready to cover the formation and advance
of his Columns of Attack, for the support of which by Artillery, the
Heights constituting his main position in rear of Gemioncourt, offered
every facility.</p>

<p>Scarcely had <span class="smcap">Picton</span>'s Division taken up its ground, when
the Duke of <span class="smcap">Brunswick</span>'s Corps arrived upon the field. It
was not complete; its Artillery (under Major <span class="smcap">Mahn</span>) and the
1st and 3rd Light Battalions (commanded by Major <span class="smcap">Holstein</span>
and Major <span class="smcap">Ebeling</span>), having been stationed in distant
cantonments, had not yet joined. The 2nd Light Battalion (under Major
<span class="smcap">Brandenstein</span>) was immediately detached to the Wood near
Piermont on the left of the position, and of which the possession had
already been secured by the 1st Battalion of the British 95th Regiment:
the two Rifle Companies of the Advanced Guard Battalion (under Major
<span class="smcap">Rauschenplatt</span>) were moved into the Wood of Bossu; on the
right of which some detachments of Cavalry were posted for the purpose
of observing the Enemy's dispositions in that quarter. The remainder
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> these troops, by a movement to their left, when close upon Quatre
Bras, deployed in rear of, and in a direction parallel to, the Namur
road, thus forming a Reserve to <span class="smcap">Picton</span>'s Division. The absent
portion of the Corps reached the field in the course of the action, as
will hereafter be explained.</p>

<p>The cannonade which had opened against the Fifth British Division as it
took up its ground, continued with unabated vigour. The French Light
Troops were now observed advancing from the inclosures that skirted
the foot of their position, and to meet them the Light Companies of
the different Regiments of <span class="smcap">Picton</span>'s Division were immediately
thrown forward. On the French extreme Right all further progress
was checked by the gallant manner in which the 1st Battalion 95th
British Regiment, though opposed by a much superior force, retained
possession of the Namur road, which they lined with their Skirmishers,
while the Wood in rear was occupied by the Battalion Reserve and
the 2nd Brunswick Light Battalion. On the French Left, however, the
incessant rattle of musketry in the Wood of Bossu plainly indicated
by its gradual approach in the direction of Quatre Bras, that the
Dutch-Belgian Infantry were yielding to the fierce onset of the Enemy
in that quarter.</p>

<p>The protection which the French would derive from the possession of
the eastern portion of this Wood for the advance of their masses
over the space between it and the Charleroi road, instantly became
apparent to the British Commander; in fact, the previous pursuit
of the Dutch-Belgian Cavalry along this road proved the expediency
of establishing some restraint to such facility for a hostile
advance in that direction; and he therefore requested the Duke of
<span class="smcap">Brunswick</span> to take up a position with a part of his Corps
between Quatre Bras and Gemioncourt, so as to have his Left resting
upon the road, and his Right communicating with <span class="smcap">Perponcher</span>'s
Division, part of which was deployed along the skirt of the Wood.</p>

<p>The Duke of <span class="smcap">Brunswick</span> immediately ordered forward the Guard
Battalion (under Major <span class="smcap">Pröstler</span>), the 1st Line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> Battalion
(under Major <span class="smcap">Metzner</span>), and the two Light Companies of the
Advanced Guard Battalion, which he posted in Close Columns upon, and
contiguous to, the road, on the ground indicated, and threw out a line
of Skirmishers connecting these Columns with the two <i>Jäger</i> Companies
in the Wood. As an immediate Support to the Infantry, he stationed the
Brunswick Hussars (under Major <span class="smcap">Cramm</span>) and Lancers (under Major
<span class="smcap">Pott</span>) in a hollow in their rear; while as a Reserve to the
whole, the 2nd and 3rd Line Battalions (under Major <span class="smcap">Strombeck</span>
and Major <span class="smcap">Norrmann</span>) were posted <i>en crémaillère</i> contiguously
to the houses of Quatre Bras, which important point they were to defend
to the last extremity.</p>

<p>Whilst this disposition on the Anglo-Allied Right was in progress,
two heavy French Columns were observed descending into a valley below
Gemioncourt, where, under cover of the strong line of Skirmishers,
which had been for some time engaged with those of <span class="smcap">Picton</span>'s
Division, they were divided into separate smaller Columns of Attack.
The cannonade from the French Heights, which now sensibly quickened,
was telling fearfully amidst the Fifth British Division; and a fresh
impulse having been given to the Enemy's Light Troops by the near
approach of their own attacking Columns, the British Skirmishers,
overpowered by numbers only, were seen darting, alternately and at
short distances, to the rear, through the line of smoke that had been
raised midway between the contending Armies.</p>

<p>At this critical moment, when the rapid progress of the French in
the Wood of Bossu, and their imposing advance against his Left Wing,
threatened to compromise his disposal of the Brunswick troops on the
right of the Charleroi road, <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, by one of those
electric inspirations of his master mind with which he had been wont in
former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> Campaigns to frustrate the best devised plans of his opponents,
resolved not to await the attack, but to meet it. He instantly ordered
the advance of <span class="smcap">Kempt</span>'s and <span class="smcap">Pack</span>'s Brigades, with the
exception of the 92nd Regiment, which (under the command of Lieutenant
Colonel <span class="smcap">Cameron</span>) was to continue at its post on the Namur
road, close to Quatre Bras.</p>

<p>During the advance of these two Brigades, which was made with admirable
steadiness and in the best order, the Skirmishers fell back upon their
respective Battalions, all of which now presented a clear front to
the Enemy. From the heads of <span class="smcap">Ney</span>'s Columns, as well as from
the thick lines of Skirmishers by which they were connected, a severe
and destructive fire was opened and maintained against the British
line, along which the gallant <span class="smcap">Picton</span>, the far famed Leader of
the no less renowned "Fighting Division" of the British Army in the
Peninsular Campaigns, was seen galloping from one Regiment to another,
encouraging his men, and inciting them by his presence and example. The
troops significantly responded to his call by those loud and animating
shouts with which British soldiers are wont to denote their eagerness
to close with their enemies. The interval between the adverse lines
was rapidly diminishing: the fire from the French suddenly began to
slacken; hesitation, quickly succeeded by disorder, became apparent in
their ranks; and then it was, that, animating each other with redoubled
cheers, the British Regiments were seen to lower their bristling
bayonets, and driving everything before them, to pursue their opponents
down to the outer fence of the valley, whence the French line had
advanced in the full confidence of triumph.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kempt</span>'s Brigade, in consequence of the greater proximity of
its original position to that of the Enemy, was the first to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> overthrow
the French Infantry. The 79th Highlanders, on the left of the line
(commanded by Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>), made a gallant
charge down the hill, dashed through the first fence, and pursued their
opponents, who had advanced in two Battalion Columns, not only across
the valley, but through the second fence; and, carried on by their
ardour, even ventured to ascend the Enemy's position. By this time,
however, their ranks were much broken: they were speedily recalled,
and as they retraced their steps across the valley, they derived
considerable support from the adjoining Battalion in the line, the 32nd
Regiment (commanded by Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Maitland</span>), which was
keeping up from the first hedge a vigorous fire against the French, who
now lined the second fence. The remaining Regiments of both Brigades
had all in like manner charged down as far as the nearest hedge, whence
they inflicted a severe loss upon their Enemies as these precipitately
retired, with their ranks completely broken and disordered on passing
through the inclosure.</p>

<p>On the right of the line, the 42nd Highlanders (commanded by Lieutenant
Colonel Sir <span class="smcap">Robert Macara</span>), and 44th Regiment (commanded by
Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Hamerton</span>), had advanced to within a very
short distance of Gemioncourt, in which, and behind the hedges lining
the valley, the French were seeking shelter.</p>

<p>During the progress of this contest on the Anglo-Allied left of the
Charleroi road, the Brunswick troops were not permitted to remain
in quiet possession of their advanced position on the right, which
indeed was well calculated to attract <span class="smcap">Ney</span>'s attention. A
Battery was immediately drawn up on the opposite Height westward of
Gemioncourt, from which, as also from the incessant fire maintained by
the Enemy's Skirmishers posted at no great distance from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> front of
the line, a very destructive fire was maintained against the Brunswick
troops. The Regiment of Hussars particularly suffered, standing in
line, and frequently receiving an entire discharge from the Battery.
The Brunswickers were, for the most part, young and inexperienced
soldiers&mdash;in every sense of the word, <i>raw</i> troops: and the numerous
casualties which befel their ranks in this exposed situation might have
produced a fatal influence upon their discipline, but for the noble
example of their Prince, whose admirable tact and calm demeanour were
most conspicuous on this trying occasion. Quietly smoking his pipe in
front of his line, he gave out his Orders as if at a mere field day;
and was only restrained from taking offence at the representations made
to him by some of his Staff of the imminent danger to which he was
exposing himself, from a consciousness of the kindly motives by which
they were dictated.</p>

<p>At length, the continued havoc created amongst his devoted followers by
the fire from the French Heights, excited the impatience of the Duke
himself for at least the means of retaliation; and as his own Artillery
was still upon the march from its cantonments, he sent to the Duke
of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> a request to be furnished with some pieces of
cannon.</p>

<p class="figcenter" ><img src="images/illus11.jpg" alt="cap" />
<a id="illus11" name="illus11"></a> </p>
<p class="caption">Brunswick</p>

<p>This was immediately acceded to, and four guns were moved forward and
posted on the right of the Brunswick Infantry; but they had scarcely
fired a few rounds when the Enemy's cannonade was redoubled; two of the
guns were quickly disabled, and several of the horses attached to the
limbers were killed. At the same time, two Columns of French Infantry
were seen advancing in succession along the edge of the Wood of Bossu,
preceded by a Battalion in line, and supported by some Cavalry, of
which description<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> of force there also appeared to be a considerable
mass advancing along the Charleroi road. As the French Infantry
rapidly approached the right of the line of the Brunswick Skirmishers,
the latter were forced to retire, as were also the Dutch-Belgian
Infantry that lined the Wood at this part of the field. The Duke of
<span class="smcap">Brunswick</span>, perceiving that the bend of the wood in rear of his
Regiment of Hussars was likely to impede the freedom of its movements,
immediately ordered the latter to proceed to the opposite side of the
Charleroi road, and retire towards Quatre Bras, there to remain in
readiness to act according to circumstances. Then, placing himself at
the head of his Lancers, he gallantly charged the advancing Infantry,
which, however, received them with so much steadiness and good order,
and opened upon them so destructive a fire, that the attack completely
failed, and the Regiment withdrew to Quatre Bras.</p>

<p>Finding the strength of the Enemy's forces to be so overpowering, the
Duke now ordered the Infantry posted contiguously to the Charleroi
road, also to retire upon the main position. The 1st Line Battalion
moved hastily along the road, while the Guard Battalion, with which
the Duke himself was at this time present, retired across the fields
eastward of the isolated House upon the Charleroi road, towards the
Allied line, posted upon the road to Namur. Major <span class="smcap">Pröstler</span>,
who commanded the Guard Battalion, rendered himself conspicuous by
his exertions to execute this movement in as orderly a manner as
possible, but the eager and close pursuit by the French Light Troops,
now emboldened by success, a shower of round shot upon the Column, and
the approach of the Enemy's Cavalry, spread such a panic among these
young troops that they fled in confusion, some through Quatre Bras,
and others through the Anglo-Allied line on the left of that point;
and it was in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> moment of attempting to rally his soldiers, not far
from the little garden of the House before mentioned, that the Duke of
<span class="smcap">Brunswick</span> was struck from his horse by a shot which terminated
the career of this gallant Prince.</p>

<p>In the mean time the Brunswick Hussars were ordered forward to cover
the retreat of the Infantry, and repel the advance of the French
Cavalry, which was now seen in rapid motion along the Charleroi
road, as if incited and emboldened by the loud shouts of triumph
sent forth by their Light Troops in front. The Hussars, whose order
while advancing, was quickly disturbed by a straggling fire from the
French Infantry, to which their Right Flank became exposed, failed in
producing the slightest check upon the Cavalry, and were soon seen
wheeling about and in full flight, closely pursued by their opponents.</p>

<p>To the 42nd Highlanders and 44th British Regiment, which were posted on
a reverse slope, and in line, close upon the left of the above road,
the advance of French Cavalry was so sudden and unexpected, the more so
as the Brunswickers had just moved on to the front, that as both these
bodies whirled past them to the rear, in such close proximity to each
other, they were, for the moment, considered to consist of one mass of
Allied Cavalry. Some of the old soldiers of both Regiments were not
so easily satisfied on this point, and immediately opened a partial
fire obliquely upon the French Lancers, which, however, Sir <span class="smcap">Denis
Pack</span> and their own Officers endeavoured as much as possible to
restrain; but no sooner had the latter succeeded in causing a cessation
of the fire, than the Lancers, which were the rearmost of the Cavalry,
wheeled sharply round, and advanced in admirable order directly upon
the rear of the two British Regiments.</p>

<p>The 42nd Highlanders having, from their position, been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> the first
to recognise them as a part of the Enemy's forces, rapidly formed
Square; but just as the two Flank Companies were running in to form the
rear face, the Lancers had reached the Regiment, when a considerable
portion of their leading division penetrated the Square, carrying
along with them, by the impetus of their charge, several men of
those two Companies, and creating a momentary confusion. The long
tried discipline and steadiness of the Highlanders, however, did not
forsake them at this most critical juncture: these Lancers, instead
of effecting the destruction of the Square, were themselves fairly
hemmed into it, and either bayoneted or taken prisoners, while the
endangered face, restored as if by magic, successfully repelled all
further attempts on the part of the French to complete their expected
triumph. Their Commanding Officer, Lieutenant Colonel Sir <span class="smcap">Robert
Macara</span>, was killed on this occasion, a lance having pierced
through his chin until it reached the brain; and within the brief space
of a few minutes, the command of the Regiment devolved upon three
other Officers in succession: Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Dick</span>, who
was severely wounded, Brevet Major <span class="smcap">Davidson</span>, who was mortally
wounded, and Brevet Major <span class="smcap">Campbell</span>, who commanded it during
the remainder of the Campaign.</p>

<p>If this Cavalry attack had fallen so unexpectedly upon the 42nd
Highlanders, still less had it been anticipated by the 44th Regiment.
Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Hamerton</span>, perceiving that the Lancers
were rapidly advancing against his rear, and that any attempt to form
square would be attended with imminent danger, instantly decided upon
receiving them in line. The low thundering sound of their approach was
heard by his men before a conviction they were French flashed across
the minds of any but the <i>old</i> soldiers who had previously fired at
them as they passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> their Flank. <span class="smcap">Hamerton</span>'s words of command
were, "Rear rank, right about face!"&mdash;"Make ready!"&mdash;(a short pause to
admit of the still nearer approach of the Cavalry)&mdash;"Present!"&mdash;"Fire!"
The effect produced by this volley was astonishing. The men, aware
of their perilous position, doubtless took a most deliberate aim
at their opponents, who were thrown into great confusion. Some few
daring fellows made a dash at the centre of the Battalion, hoping to
capture the Colours, in their apparently exposed situation; but the
attempt, though gallantly made, was as gallantly defeated. The Lancers
now commenced a flight towards the French position by the Flanks of
the 44th. As they rushed past the Left Flank, the Officer commanding
the Light Company, who had very judiciously restrained his men from
joining in the volley given to the rear, opened upon them a scattering
fire; and no sooner did the Lancers appear in the proper front of the
Regiment, when the front rank began in its turn to contribute to their
overthrow and destruction.</p>

<p>Never, perhaps, did British Infantry display its characteristic
coolness and steadiness more eminently than on this trying occasion.
To have stood in a thin two deep line, awaiting, and prepared to
receive, the onset of hostile Cavalry, would have been looked upon at
least as a most hazardous experiment; but, with its rear so suddenly
menaced, and its flanks unsupported, to have instantly faced only one
rank about, to have stood as if rooted to the ground, to have repulsed
its assailants with so steady and well directed a fire that numbers of
them were destroyed&mdash;this was a feat of arms which the oldest or best
disciplined Corps in the world might have in vain hoped to accomplish;
yet most successfully and completely was this achieved by the gallant
2nd Battalion of the 44th British Regiment, under its brave Commander,
Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Hamerton</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>In this attack occurred one of these incidents which, in daring, equal
any of the feats of ancient chivalry, which makes the wildest fables
of the deeds of the knights of old appear almost impossible; which
cause the bearing of an individual to stand out, as it were, in relief
amidst the operations of the masses; and which, by their characteristic
recklessness, almost invariably insure at least a partial success.</p>

<p>A French Lancer gallantly charged at the Colours, and severely wounded
Ensign <span class="smcap">Christie</span>, who carried one of them, by a thrust of his
lance, which, entering the left eye, penetrated to the lower jaw.
The Frenchman then endeavoured to seize the Standard, but the brave
<span class="smcap">Christie</span>, notwithstanding the agony of his wound, with a
presence of mind almost unequalled, flung himself upon it&mdash;not to save
himself, but to preserve the honour of his Regiment. As the Colour
fluttered in its fall, the Frenchman tore off a portion of the silk
with the point of his lance; but he was not permitted to bear the
fragment beyond the ranks. Both shot and bayoneted by the nearest of
the soldiers of the 44th, he was borne to the earth, paying with the
sacrifice of his life for his display of unavailing bravery.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the leading portion of <span class="smcap">Piré</span>'s Light
Cavalry, from which the Lancers that attacked the 42nd and 44th
British Regiments had been detached, as already described, continued
its advance along the high road towards Quatre Bras, driving in the
Brunswick Hussars, who were now galloping confusedly upon the 92nd
Highlanders then lining the ditch of the Namur high road contiguous
to Quatre Bras. Pursued by the <i>Chasseurs à Cheval</i>, and finding
no opening for their passage, they made for the Right Flank of the
Regiment: and, as they were flying past, the Grenadier Company was
wheeled back upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> the road so as to oppose a front at that point
to the flank of the pursuing Cavalry, upon which the Highlanders
now poured a most destructive volley. The shock thus occasioned to
the French Cavalry was immediately perceptible; but though thrown
into confusion, the main body soon reformed, and retired with much
steadiness and regularity.</p>

<p>The front of the Column, however, impelled by the furious ardour with
which it had advanced, or, perhaps, imagining itself still followed
and supported by the main body, dashed in amongst the houses of Quatre
Bras, and even advanced to some distance beyond them, cutting down
several stragglers whom they found there, principally belonging to
the routed Brunswick Infantry, as also groups of wounded. Many of
them rushed through the large opening into the Farm Yard of Quatre
Bras, which was situated immediately in rear of the Right of the 92nd.
A few daring fellows finding they had proceeded too far to be able
to retire by the same direction in which they had advanced, wheeled
round suddenly at the point where the high roads intersect each other,
and galloped right through the Grenadier Company of the Highlanders,
shouting, and brandishing their swords, and receiving a fire from some
of the rear rank of the Regiment as they dashed along the road. None
of them escaped: one, an Officer of the <i>Chasseurs à Cheval</i>, had
already reached the spot where the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> was
at that moment stationed in rear of the Highlanders. Some of the men
immediately turned round and fired: his horse was killed, and at the
same moment a musket ball passed through each foot of the gallant young
Officer. Those of the French <i>Chasseurs</i> who had entered the Farm Yard,
finding no other outlet, now began to gallop back, in small parties
of two or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> three at a time, but few escaped the deadly fire of the
Highlanders.</p>

<p>About this time, <span class="smcap">Kellermann</span> reached the Field, with
the Eleventh Heavy Cavalry Division under Lieutenant General
<span class="smcap">l'Heritier</span>. This augmented <span class="smcap">Ney</span>'s forces to the

<p>The French Infantry upon the extreme Left had by this time possessed
themselves of the greater portion of the Wood of Bossu, from the Allied
rear of which numerous groups of wounded and runaways were now seen
to emerge; indeed, it soon became evident that no dependance could be
placed on the continued occupation of the Wood by the Dutch-Belgian
forces, and that the whole brunt of the Battle would have to be borne
by the British, Hanoverian, and Brunswick forces. Upon the extreme
French Right, all attempts to turn the opposite Flank of the Allies
were successfully checked by the steadiness and gallantry of the 95th
British Regiment, supported by the 2nd Brunswick Light Battalion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ney</span>, although he had failed in his first general attack upon
the Anglo-Allied line, had fully ascertained that the raw troops
of which the Dutch-Belgian and Brunswick Cavalry in the Field were
composed, were totally incapable of competing with his own veteran
warriors of that Arm, and he therefore determined to take advantage of
<span class="smcap">Kellermann</span>'s arrival for the execution of a vigorous Cavalry
attack.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> Retaining General <span class="smcap">Piquet</span>'s Brigade in reserve,
he combined, for this purpose, General <span class="smcap">Guyton</span>'s Brigade,
consisting of the 8th and 11th <i>Cuirassiers</i>, with <span class="smcap">Piré</span>'s
Light Cavalry Division; and also taking advantage of his greatly
superior Artillery force, he caused the attack to be preceded and
covered by a tremendous cannonade, occasioning great havoc in the ranks
of the Anglo-Allied Infantry, the range for which the French Gunners
had by this time ascertained with fearful precision.</p>

<p>It was not long before the British Battalions most in advance were
warned of the approach of hostile Cavalry by the running in of their
Skirmishers; and scarcely had they formed their Squares when the
Batteries respectively opposed to them having ceased their fire,
a rushing sound was heard through the tall corn, which, gradually
bending, disclosed to their view the heads of the attacking Columns;
and now began a conflict wherein the cool and daring intrepidity with
which British Infantry are accustomed to defy the assaults of Cavalry
was exemplified in a manner that will ever reflect honour and glory
upon the Regiments to whose lot it fell, on this memorable Field, to
assert and maintain their country's prowess. A rolling fire from the
muskets of the 42nd Highlanders and 44th British Regiment, given at a
moment when the Enemy's horsemen were almost close upon their bayonets,
though most destructive in its effects upon their own immediate
opponents, checked not the ardour and impetuosity of the general
attack. These two diminutive Squares, now completely surrounded by the
French Cavalry, seemed destined to become a sacrifice to the fury with
which a rapid succession of attacks was made upon them; no sooner was
one Squadron hurled back in confusion, than another rushed impetuously
forward upon the same face of a Square, to experience a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> similar fate;
and sometimes different faces were charged simultaneously.</p>

<p class="figcenter" ><img src="images/illus12.jpg" alt="cap" />
<a id="illus12" name="illus12"></a> </p>
<p class="caption">Picton</p>

<p>A strong body of <i>Cuirassiers</i> now passed the Right Flank of the two
Regiments, along the high road, with an evident intention of making
another attempt upon Quatre Bras.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Picton</span>, who had been watching with intense anxiety the contest
maintained by the 42nd and 44th British Regiments in their exposed
situation, and who had become convinced of the utter hopelessness of
obtaining any efficient support from the Allied Cavalry then in the
field, could no longer restrain his impatience to fly to the rescue
of the devoted Squares; and, as a substitute for Cavalry, he decided
upon immediately assailing that of the Enemy with his own oft tried
Infantry. With this view, he united the Royals (under Lieutenant
Colonel <span class="smcap">Colin Campbell</span>) and the 28th Regiment, both of which
Corps were at that moment standing in Column at quarter distance. Led
on by both <span class="smcap">Picton</span> and <span class="smcap">Kempt</span>, the united Column, with
loud shouts, boldly advanced into the midst of the Enemy's Cavalry; the
whole extent of ground along its front appeared to swarm with Lancers,
<i>Chasseurs à Cheval</i>, and <i>Cuirassiers</i>, a considerable portion of
whom were now seen rapidly forming for an attack upon the Column;
but <span class="smcap">Picton</span> constantly on the alert, and at the same time
desirous of arriving at such a distance as would enable him to present
an efficient flank fire in support of the 44th Regiment, continued
advancing until the last moment, when he suddenly formed it into Square.</p>

<p>The repeated and furious charges which ensued, were invariably repulsed
by the Royals and the 28th, with the utmost steadiness and consummate
bravery; and although the Lancers individually dashed forward and
frequently wounded the men in the ranks, yet all endeavours to effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
an opening, of which the succeeding Squadron of Attack might take
advantage, completely failed. The ground on which the Square stood
was such that the surrounding remarkably tall rye concealed it in
a great measure, in the first attacks, from the view of the French
Cavalry until the latter came quite close upon it; but to remedy this
inconvenience, and to preserve the impetus of their charge, the Lancers
had frequently recourse to sending forward a daring individual to plant
a lance in the earth at a very short distance from the bayonets, and
they then charged upon the lance flag as a mark of direction.</p>

<p>The advance of the Royals and the 28th had been almost immediately
followed, under the same form, by that of the 32nd Regiment, which,
having reached a convenient distance, halted, and formed Square so as
to support, at the same time, by a flank fire, the Royals and 28th, and
the Square of the 79th Highlanders, which latter Regiment constituted a
connecting link with the 95th British Regiment upon the extreme Left.</p>

<p>Upon the advance of the Regiments belonging to <span class="smcap">Kempt</span>'s and
<span class="smcap">Pack</span>'s British Brigades, <span class="smcap">Best</span>'s Hanoverian Brigade
occupied the Namur road in their rear, along which the Landwehr
Battalions Lüneburg, Osterode, and Münden (respectively commanded by
Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Ramdohr</span>, Major <span class="smcap">Reden</span>, and Major
<span class="smcap">Schmid</span>) were deployed, while the Landwehr Battalion Verden
(under Major <span class="smcap">Decken</span>), also in line, was posted somewhat in
advance.</p>

<p>In this position, <span class="smcap">Picton</span>'s Division sustained repeated
assaults of the French Cavalry, which attacked the Squares
simultaneously, and in every direction: as a portion rushed upon one
Square, other Squadrons passed on to assail the next; some parties,
taking advantage of sinuosities of the ground, awaited, like birds
of prey, the favourable moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> for pouncing upon their victims; no
sooner was one attacking Squadron driven back and dispersed by a stream
of musketry from the face of a Square, than a fresh party would rush
from its cover upon the same ranks, in the vain hope that the means of
breaking its onset had been expended; but a reserved fire never failed
to bring down upon it a similar fate. Viewed from a little distance,
the British Squares could at times be scarcely discerned amidst the
surrounding Cavalry; and as the latter was frequently observed flying
back from sudden discharges of musketry, a spectator might easily have
imagined the Squares to be so many immense bombs, with every explosion
scattering death and confusion among the masses that rushed so daringly
into their fatal vicinity.</p>

<p>The French Cavalry, by its repeated failures to make any impression
on the British Infantry by the manner in which it had passed through
and through the intervals between the Squares, and in which the
charging Squadrons when dispersed had got intermingled, was now in
great disorder&mdash;Lancers, <i>Chasseurs</i>, and <i>Cuirassiers</i>, were mixed
together and crossing one another in every direction, seeking out their
respective Corps. To retire and reform had therefore become with them
an absolutely necessary measure; but this afforded no respite to the
devoted Squares, against which the Batteries upon the French Heights
now played with terrific effect.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>During the French attack of the British Squares on the eastern side
of the Charleroi road, a considerable body of <i>Cuirassiers</i> advanced
along the latter, with the evident design of making another attack upon
the Anglo-Allied Centre at Quatre Bras. The Belgian Cavalry, which was
again ordered forward, endeavoured to check this movement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> but with
no better effect than that which attended its former attempt; in fact,
it retired sooner, charged and pursued by the <i>Cuirassiers</i>, against
whom a rapid fire was now opened from the 92nd Highlanders, who still
lined the ditch of the Namur road, close to Quatre Bras, a fire so
destructive in its effects that the steel clad warriors were completely
staggered, and the order of their advance so thoroughly shaken that
they were compelled to retire in confusion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In addition to the furious cannonade to which they were subjected,
the foremost of <span class="smcap">Picton</span>'s British Battalions, more especially
the 42nd and 44th Regiments, were exposed to a rapid and destructive
fire, which, as soon as the Enemy's Cavalry had been withdrawn, was
opened upon them by the French troops advancing from the inclosures of
Gemioncourt. To check this, Skirmishers were thrown forward, but from
the want of sufficient ammunition, they could reply but very feebly to
the fire of their opponents, who, not suffering the same disadvantage,
were picking them off as fast as they could load. Their line soon
became fearfully thinned, and finally their ammunition was totally
exhausted, to which circumstance the Officer on whom the command of
them had devolved (Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Riddock</span>, 44th Regiment) called
the attention of Sir <span class="smcap">Denis Pack</span>, who ordered him to close his
men to their centre and to join his own Regiment.</p>

<p>He had just executed the first part of the Order, when the French
Cavalry having rallied and reformed, renewed their attacks upon the
British Squares. Squadrons of <i>Cuirassiers</i> and Lancers, in their
onward course, swept past Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Riddock</span> and his party,
while others intercepted his direct line of retreat. He instantly
formed four deep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span> and with his front rank at the charge, he made
good his way through the Enemy's Cavalry, as far as the south face of
the Square formed by the 44th Regiment; which, however, was so hotly
pressed at the moment as to be unable to receive him, whereupon he
ordered his men to lie down close to their bayonets, until a favourable
opportunity should offer for their admission within the Square.</p>

<p>A repetition of the former scene on this part of the Field now took
place, and the attacks, which were conducted with similar impetuosity,
were met by a resistance equally undaunted. As if to overawe the Square
formed by the Royals and 28th British Regiments, the French Cavalry now
made a simultaneous attack upon three of its faces, and these consisted
mainly of the latter Corps. <span class="smcap">Picton</span>, who was again in the
Square, upon perceiving the approach of this apparently overwhelming
force, suddenly and emphatically exclaimed, "28th! remember Egypt!"
They answered him with a loud cheer, and reserving their fire until
the Cavalry had approached within a few yards of the Square, their
muskets were coolly and deliberately levelled at their assailants,
who in the next moment were hurled back in wild disorder, horses and
riders tumbling over one another, and creating indescribable confusion.
Similar in their results were all the attacks made upon the other
British Squares, which maintained their ground with the same unshaken
steadiness and gallantry.</p>

<p>These repeated charges by the French Cavalry, though conducted by
veteran soldiers, with admirable order and compactness, and though
affording innumerable instances of individual gallantry and daring,
were certainly not carried on in a manner calculated to ensure success
over Infantry distinguished by such high training and such undaunted
bravery as the British proved themselves to possess on this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> memorable
occasion. There was no indication of a systematic attack upon any
particular point by a rapid succession of charging Squadrons&mdash;no
<i>forlorn hope like</i> rush upon the opposing bayonets by the survivors of
a discharge of musketry levelled at a leading Squadron, and that rush
followed up with lightning-like rapidity by the next Squadron, which,
in spite of the intervening space encumbered with the bodies of men and
horses overthrown in the first charge, would thus obtain the greatest
chance of effecting by its own weight and compact order, a breach in
the Square at the point originally selected for the assault.</p>

<p>No such system of attack was attempted; but, on the contrary, it almost
invariably happened that the leading Squadron no sooner received the
fire from the point attacked, than it either opened out from the centre
to the right and left, and retired, or, it diverged altogether to one
flank, leaving the succeeding divisions, in both cases, to observe the
same movement; and, in this manner, the whole of the attacking force
exposed itself to a far more extended range of fire and consequent
loss, than if it had pursued the more daring, and at the same time,
more decisive, mode of attack just described.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whilst a considerable portion of the French Cavalry was thus
fruitlessly assailing the British Squares, a body of Lancers, which
had advanced considerably in the rear of those Squares, made a sudden
and unexpected charge upon the Hanoverian Landwehr Battalion Verden,
which was then, as previously explained, deployed a short distance in
front of the Namur road: it was completely successful, and the greater
part of the Battalion was cut down by the Lancers, who, emboldened by
this triumph, were preparing to cross the Namur road, where a well
directed fire opened upon them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> by the Landwehr Battalions Lüneburg and
Osterode, lying concealed in the ditch by which it was lined, threw
them into disorder, and forced them to a precipitate retreat.</p>

<p>The whole of the French Cavalry was now withdrawn for the purpose of
reforming its broken and disordered ranks, leaving the Anglo-Allied
Infantry to be again assailed by a vigorous cannonade from the Heights
above Gemioncourt. The only movement on the part of the Anglo-Allied
forces was the advance of the Brunswick Guard Battalion and 2nd Line
Battalion in front of Quatre Bras, by the right of the Charleroi
road, as a precautionary measure against any flank attack that might
be attempted from the Wood of Bossu upon the advanced Battalions of
<span class="smcap">Picton</span>'s right.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was long past five o'clock. The French Infantry in the Wood of
Bossu was continually making progress towards the Namur road, across
which increased numbers of the Dutch-Belgian troops, to whom the
defence of the Wood had been entrusted, were seen hastily retiring. In
Piermont, the French Light Troops had been reinforced, and they were
now evidently preparing for a more vigorous attack upon the extreme
Left of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s forces; whilst certain movements in the
vicinity of Gemioncourt gave intimation of an intended renewal of the
attack upon Quatre Bras. All prospect of the Anglo-Allied Cavalry
encountering <span class="smcap">Ney</span>'s veteran Dragoons with any chance of success
had entirely vanished; whilst, on the other hand, the latter were
on the point of being reinforced by the arrival of another Cavalry
Division. <span class="smcap">Pack</span>'s Brigade had expended nearly the whole of its
ammunition; its exposed position, and the continued Cavalry charges in
its rear having precluded the transmission of the necessary supply. The
Brunswickers had been greatly discouraged by the death of their gallant
Prince; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> losses sustained by all the troops engaged had already
been truly frightful.</p>

<p>It was at this very moment, when <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s situation
had become so extremely critical, that two Infantry Brigades of the
Third Division, under Lieutenant General Sir <span class="smcap">Charles Alten</span>,
most opportunely reached the Field of Action by the Nivelles road.
They were the Fifth British Brigade, commanded by Major General Sir
<span class="smcap">Colin Halkett</span>, and the First Hanoverian Brigade, under Major
General Count <span class="smcap">Kielmansegge</span>; and were accompanied by Major
<span class="smcap">Lloyd</span>'s Battery of British Foot Artillery, and by Captain
<span class="smcap">Cleeves</span>'s Battery of Hanoverian Foot Artillery.</p>

<p>By the arrival of these troops <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s force was
augmented as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ney</span>, on perceiving the arrival of this reinforcement to the
Anglo-Allied troops, despatched a peremptory Order to <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>
to hasten to his support and join him without a moment's delay; and
having well calculated the advantages he still retained, he resolved
upon a bold and vigorous effort to secure the victory.</p>

<p>The greater portion of the Wood of Bossu was now in his possession; and
this circumstance appeared to him to present the means of establishing
himself at Quatre Bras, and of thus enabling him effectually to turn
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Right Flank, and cut off his line of retreat
upon Brussels. With this view he had already greatly reinforced his
Infantry in the Wood through which he had even ordered the advance of
two Batteries, in a direction parallel to, and within a very short
distance of, its eastern boundary, so that they might be prepared to
act upon the plain, as soon as circumstances rendered such a proceeding
advisable or expedient. He now also threw forward additional Light
Troops to strengthen his extreme Right in the vicinity of Piermont;
whilst his Cavalry, so vastly superior, both in numbers and in
efficiency, to that which the British Commander had brought into the
Field, constituted his main central force, and compensated in a great
measure for the deficiency created in this point of his line by the
drawing off of the Infantry to the Flanks.</p>

<p>The two French Batteries above alluded to as having advanced along the
interior of the Wood of Bossu, suddenly opened a destructive fire from
the edge of the latter upon the Brunswick troops posted on the right of
the Charleroi road, just as <span class="smcap">Lloyd</span>'s Battery arrived at Quatre
Bras. The Duke instantly ordered the advance of this Battery into the
open space between the Charleroi road and the Wood, for the purpose
of silencing the French guns; but before the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> Artillerymen
could unlimber, several horses of the Battery were killed, wheels were
disabled, and, from the proximity of the Enemy's guns, some of the
Gunners were literally cut in two by the round shot with which they
were so closely assailed. Nevertheless, the Battery succeeded, not only
in silencing its opponents, but also in forcing back into the wood
a French Column of Infantry, which, advancing directly towards the
Brussels road, had endeavoured to turn its Right Flank: after which
brilliant services, <span class="smcap">Lloyd</span>, perceiving no adequate Support,
judged it prudent, in the then crippled state of his Battery, to
retire to his former Post, abandoning two guns for which he had not a
sufficient number of horses remaining, and which consequently could not
be recovered until the termination of the action.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halkett</span>'s Brigade, shortly after passing Quatre Bras, was
ordered to bring up its left shoulders; and, entering the rye fields in
front of the Namur road, it proceeded some little distance in advance,
and halted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kielmansegge</span>'s Brigade continued its march along the Namur
road, and received Orders to strengthen the extreme Left, as also
to support, and, where necessary, to relieve the exhausted British
Battalions, which had so bravely withstood the fiercest onsets of
a most daring and well organised Cavalry, and had so unflinchingly
endured the incessant cannonade maintained against them by the well
served Batteries on the French Heights.</p>

<p>It was during the advance of the Third British Division to take up
its ground&mdash;<span class="smcap">Halkett</span> proceeding directly to the front, and
<span class="smcap">Kielmansegge</span> moving along the Namur road to the left&mdash;and
under cover of the heavy cannonade which was maintained against the
Allied line at this time, that again a Column of French Infantry
advanced from out of the Wood, towards the Brussels road, and entering
the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> by the isolated House southward of Quatre Bras, established
itself in and about that building and its inclosures.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, another Column advanced in support of the former
one, which then emerged from its cover, and began to ascend that part
of the Anglo-Allied position occupied by the 92nd Highlanders. On
perceiving this, Major General <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>, Adjutant General to the
British forces, who had just ridden up to the right of the Regiment,
placed himself very conspicuously at the head of the Highlanders,
waving his hat, and exclaiming, "92nd, follow me!" In an instant the
latter sprang out of the ditch in which they had hitherto been posted,
and with great gallantry and steadiness charged down the slope. The
French Infantry hastily fell back, until having gained the partial
shelter afforded them by the isolated House and its inclosures, they
opened a most destructive fire upon the Highlanders, who nevertheless
slackened not their pace, but drove the French out of their cover.
Their Commanding Officer, Colonel <span class="smcap">Cameron</span>, here received his
death wound, and having lost the power of managing his horse, the
latter carried him at its utmost speed along the road until he reached
Quatre Bras, where his servant was standing with his led horse, when
the animal, suddenly stopping, pitched the unfortunate Officer on his
head. The supporting Column, however, securing the garden opposite
to the House and on the right of the road, seemed resolved to make a
stand against the further advance of the Highlanders; but the latter,
by a judicious disposition of their force in three divisions&mdash;one
towards each flank of the garden, and the other directly to the gate
in front&mdash;and again uniting as soon as these points were secured, once
more rushed upon their foes with the bayonet, displaying, under a
terrific fire, the most undaunted bravery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the French turned their backs, the 92nd poured upon them
a volley which proved most destructive, and continued their advance,
pursuing the Enemy along the edge of the Wood, into which they finally
retired upon perceiving a disposition on the part of the French Cavalry
to charge, and finding themselves exposed to a heavy cannonade which
was rapidly thinning their ranks to a fearful extent. Subsequently, in
consequence of their very severe loss, they were withdrawn through the
Wood to Quatre Bras.</p>

<p>Again the French Skirmishers were creeping up the slope from the
Gemioncourt inclosures, and <span class="smcap">Pack</span>, who had united the remains
of the 42nd and 44th Regiments into one Battalion, made the best
show of resistance in his power to their teazing <i>tiraillade</i>; but
being aware how very small a quantity of ammunition remained in his
men's pouches, his anxiety on this point became extreme, the more so
as he had good reasons for apprehending fresh attacks of Cavalry.
His advanced position in the immediate proximity of the formation
of the Enemy's Columns of Attack, naturally kept him on the look
out for effective British support; and on observing the head of
<span class="smcap">Halkett</span>'s Brigade, as the latter was advancing from Quatre
Bras, he instantly despatched an Aide de Camp to that General, with
a message, that his own Brigade had expended nearly the whole of its
ammunition, and that if he did not offer him a Support, he would be
under the necessity of almost immediately abandoning his position.
<span class="smcap">Halkett</span> at once acceded to the proposal by sending forward the
69th British Regiment, and desiring its Commanding Officer, Colonel
<span class="smcap">Morice</span>, to obey any Orders he might receive from General
<span class="smcap">Pack</span>.</p>

<p>In pursuance of Orders received from the Duke, <span class="smcap">Halkett</span> moved
the remainder of his Brigade into the space between the Wood of Bossu
and the Charleroi road, fronting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> French Left Wing. Here he found
the Brunswick Infantry retiring with precipitation: he immediately
put himself in communication with their Commanding Officer, Colonel
<span class="smcap">Olfermann</span>, and by aid of the support which his Brigade
presented to their view, he succeeded in bringing them up under cover,
in the ditch which, traversing the space between the Wood and the high
road, ran nearly parallel with the Enemy's line.</p>

<p>Leaving his Brigade in the position he had taken up, in support of the
Brunswickers and of <span class="smcap">Pack</span>'s Brigade, and pending the arrival
of further instructions from the Duke, <span class="smcap">Halkett</span> galloped to
the Front, nearly beyond the Farm of Gemioncourt, for the purpose
of ascertaining, if possible, the disposition and intentions of the
Enemy. He was not kept long in suspense, <span class="smcap">Ney</span>'s arrangements
for another general attack having been concluded; and, observing the
Cavalry destined to advance against the Allies on both sides of the
Charleroi road in motion, he turned round his horse and hastened to
dispose his Brigade in such a manner as to render it fully prepared
to brave the coming storm. On his way, he sent an intimation to
<span class="smcap">Pack</span> of his discovery, and Orders to the 69th Regiment to
prepare forthwith to receive Cavalry.</p>

<p>A sudden and heavy cannonade had already opened from the French
Heights&mdash;a sure prelude to the attack which was about to take
place&mdash;and the 69th Regiment was in the act of forming Square, when
the Prince of <span class="smcap">Orange</span> rode up to it and asked what it was
doing. Colonel <span class="smcap">Morice</span> explained that he was forming Square in
pursuance of the instructions he had received; upon which His Royal
Highness, remarking that he did not think there was any chance of the
Cavalry coming on, ordered him to reform Column, and to deploy into
line. During this last move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>ment a strong body of French <i>Cuirassiers</i>,
taking advantage of the surrounding high corn, and of the circumstance
of the Regiment lying in a hollow, approached unperceived quite close
to the spot, and rushing suddenly and impetuously upon a Flank,
succeeded in completely rolling up the Regiment, riding along and over
the unfortunate men, of whom great numbers were cut down, and in the
midst of the confusion thus created, captured and carried off one of
the Colours; in defence of which Major <span class="smcap">Lindsay</span>, Lieutenant
<span class="smcap">Pigot</span>, and Volunteer <span class="smcap">Clarke</span>, highly distinguished
themselves, and were desperately wounded. Some Officers and men
took shelter in the Square formed by the 42nd and 44th Regiments;
the mounted Officers gained the other side of the road, pursued by
about twenty of the Enemy, and escaped by riding through one of the
Hanoverian Battalions lining the Namur road.</p>

<p>The 30th Regiment, which had also been deployed into line by the
Orders of the Prince of <span class="smcap">Orange</span>, most fortunately discovered,
in sufficient time, the approach of Cavalry (notwithstanding
the extraordinary height of the rye, which greatly impeded all
observation), formed Square with remarkable rapidity, and, reserving
their fire until the very last moment, they completely dispersed
and drove off a body of <span class="smcap">Piré</span>'s Lancers, and a portion of
<span class="smcap">Kellermann</span>'s <i>Cuirassiers</i>, which troops had made a charge
upon them, enveloping two faces of their Square. <span class="smcap">Picton</span>,
who, from the opposite side of the high road, was an eye witness of
this scene, was so much pleased with the perfect steadiness of the
Regiment, that, seizing a favourable opportunity of galloping up to
it, he called for the Commanding Officer, and told Lieutenant Colonel
<span class="smcap">Hamilton</span> that he should report to the Duke the gallant conduct
of his Corps. Indeed the steadiness and gallantry of the 30th in
this Battle were so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> conspicuous as also to draw upon them the well
merited commendations of the Prince of <span class="smcap">Orange</span>, and Generals
<span class="smcap">Alten</span>, <span class="smcap">Halkett</span>, and <span class="smcap">Kielmansegge</span>.</p>

<p>The 73rd Regiment (under Colonel <span class="smcap">Harris</span>), and the
Brunswickers, were equally on the alert; but the French Cavalry, on
finding them prepared, diverged towards the high road.</p>

<p>The 33rd Regiment (under Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Elphinstone</span>), had
formed Square upon its leading Company (the Grenadiers) at the moment
the latter had reached some rising ground; in which position it became
a conspicuous mark for the fire, at point blank distance, of a French
Battery which opened upon it with great spirit. It was deemed advisable
to deploy it into line, in which formation the Regiment advanced
towards the two Brunswick Battalions then fiercely engaged with the
Enemy's Light Troops near the skirt of the Wood; but upon approaching
the latter, a report was spread along the line that French Cavalry was
in its rear, whereupon the Regiment rushed precipitately into the Wood,
within which it was speedily reformed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whilst that portion of <span class="smcap">Kellermann</span>'s Dragoons which had
dispersed the 69th Regiment, were sweeping gallantly onwards in their
bold career along the high road towards Quatre Bras, the greater body
of this Corps advanced into the open space on the right of that road.
Here <span class="smcap">Picton</span>'s gallant little bands found themselves again
involved in one general onset of Cavalry, made with a violence and
fury which seemed to betoken a desperate resolve to harass the devoted
Squares to the last extremity, and to carry every thing by main force.
At the same time a dense cloud of Skirmishers, bursting forth from the
inclosures of Piermont,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> threatened to turn the extreme Left of the
Anglo-Allied Army; whilst the French Infantry in the Wood of Bossu,
close upon the northern boundary of the latter, equally endangered its
extreme Right.</p>

<p>At this moment, <span class="smcap">Ney</span>'s prospects were bright enough to justify
his hopes of success, and he hailed the captured Colour, presented
to him by the <i>Cuirassier</i> <span class="smcap">Lami</span> of the 8th Regiment, as
the harbinger of victory. In fact, on whatever point of his line
<span class="smcap">Ney</span> now directed his view, his operations were full of promise
as to the result.</p>

<p>It was certainly a most anxious moment to the British Chief: but
frightfully crippled as were his resources by the failure and hasty
retreat of the great bulk of the Dutch-Belgian Infantry, by the
evident inferiority and utter helplessness of his Cavalry, and by the
dreadfully severe losses already inflicted upon his British Regiments,
he calmly surveyed the field of slaughter, and deliberately calculated
upon the extent to which the heroic valour and admirable spirit so
unequivocally displayed by the British and German Infantry would
enable him to bear up against the storm that now spread its fury along
his whole line, until his eagle glance might detect some favourable
opening, seize some critical moment, to deal the stroke that, by a
combination as sudden as the launching of the thunderbolt of the storm
itself, should avert its fury, or oppose to it a barrier that might
exhaust its strength.</p>

<p>The arrival of <span class="smcap">Lloyd</span>'s British, and <span class="smcap">Cleeves</span>'s German,
Batteries, attached to <span class="smcap">Alten</span>'s Division, had already made a
most important addition to the Duke's Artillery force; the former took
post in front of Quatre Bras on the right, the latter on the left, of
the Charleroi road.</p>

<p>Almost immediately afterwards, Major <span class="smcap">Kuhlmann</span>'s Battery of
Horse Artillery of the King's German Legion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> belonging to the First
Division, which it had preceded on the Nivelles road, reached the
Field, and moved rapidly to the point of intersection of the Brussels
and Nivelles road, where it came into action, at the very moment the
<i>Cuirassiers</i> who had fallen upon <span class="smcap">Halkett</span>'s Brigade were
advancing in mass along the former road towards Quatre Bras. Two
guns under Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Speckmann</span> were posted so as to bear
directly upon the French Column, and completely to enfilade the road;
and as the Cuirassiers approached with the undaunted bearing that
betokened the steadiness of veterans, and with the imposing display
that usually distinguishes mailed Cavalry, a remarkably well directed
fire was opened upon them: in an instant the whole mass appeared in
irretrievable confusion; the road was literally strewed with corses of
these steel clad warriors and their gallant steeds; <span class="smcap">Kellermann</span>
himself was dismounted, and compelled like many of his followers to
retire on foot.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was at this moment that Colonel <span class="smcap">Laurent</span>, who had been
despatched from the Imperial Head Quarters, reached <span class="smcap">Ney</span>,
with a pencilled note requiring the Marshal to detach the First Corps
towards St Amand. Having fallen in with the head of the Column of that
Corps, he had taken upon himself to alter the direction of its march;
and, on coming up with Count <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>, who had preceded his
Corps, and was then in front of Frasne, he showed him the note, and
explained to him where he would find the head of his Column. Shortly
afterwards, General <span class="smcap">d'Elcambre</span>, Chief of the Staff to the
First Corps, arrived to report the movement which was in course of
execution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ney</span> now saw clearly that at the very moment he required the
aid of <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s Corps, not only to counterbalance the arrival
of reinforcements which had joined <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> to give
an efficient support to the renewed general attack he had projected,
that Corps had been placed beyond his reach, and that he must, in all
probability, continue to fight the battle without any addition to the
force he had already in the Field. Nevertheless, he did not allow the
circumstance to suspend the execution of his operations; and, with the
hope of yet securing the assistance of the First Corps, he sent back
General <span class="smcap">d'Elcambre</span>, with a peremptory Order for its return
towards Quatre Bras.</p>

<p>It was soon after this that <span class="smcap">Ney</span> received another despatch
from <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, dated at two o'clock. From its general
tenor it was evidently written previously to the departure of
Colonel <span class="smcap">Laurent</span> with the Order for the flank movement of
<span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s Corps, and therefore the bearer of it must have
taken longer time than was necessary in conveying it to the Marshal.
It announced that the Prussians were posted between Sombref and Bry,
and that at half past two <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> was to attack them with the
Third and Fourth <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, and expressed the Emperor's wish that
<span class="smcap">Ney</span> should also attack whatever Enemy might be in his front,
and, after having repulsed the latter, fall back in the direction of
Ligny, to assist in enveloping the Prussians. At the same time it
stated, that should <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> succeed in defeating the latter
beforehand, he would then man&oelig;uvre in <span class="smcap">Ney</span>'s direction,
to support in like manner the Marshal's operations. It concluded by
requesting information both as to <span class="smcap">Ney</span>'s own dispositions and
those of the Enemy in his front. This despatch reached <span class="smcap">Ney</span>
at a moment when he was most seriously engaged, when the issue of the
battle was extremely doubtful, and the probability of his being enabled
to afford the support required by <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> most questionable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon the extreme Left of the Anglo-Allied forces, the advance of the
French Light Troops from Piermont and its vicinity was met in a most
determined and gallant manner by the head of <span class="smcap">Kielmansegge</span>'s
Hanoverian Brigade (which after having moved along the Nivelles
road, exposed to the continued fire from the Batteries on the French
Heights, had just reached that part of the field), in conjunction with
the 1st Battalion 95th British Rifles, and the 2nd Brunswick Light
Battalion. The most determined efforts were made by the Enemy to turn
the Anglo-Allied Flank. The French Infantry had already gained the high
road, and were boldly pressing forward, when the British Rifles, the
Brunswick Light Infantry, and the Hanoverian Field Battalion Lüneburg
(under Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Klencke</span>) dashed in amongst them. The
contest was obstinate and severe; but the Allied Light Troops having
been reinforced by the Hanoverian Field Battalion Grubenhagen (under
Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Wurmb</span>), gradually obtained the ascendancy,
and, dislodging their opponents from one inclosure after another,
continued steadily advancing, and gaining ground.</p>

<p>Along the whole front of the central portion of the Anglo-Allied Army,
the French Cavalry was expending its force in repeated but unavailing
charges against the indomitable Squares. The gallant, the brilliant,
the heroic, manner in which the remnants of <span class="smcap">Kempt</span>'s and
<span class="smcap">Pack</span>'s Brigades held their ground, of which they surrendered
not a single inch throughout the terrific struggle of that day, must
ever stand pre-eminent in the records of the triumphs and prowess of
British Infantry.</p>

<p>To relieve them as much as possible from the severe pressure they
experienced, now that their ammunition was almost entirely exhausted,
some of the Hanoverian Battalions were judiciously thrown forward so
as to afford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> them a close, immediate, and efficient, support, while
others continued to line the Namur road; a disposition for which the
arrival of <span class="smcap">Kielmansegge</span>'s Brigade had presented the ready
means, and which imposed an impregnable barrier to any further advance
of the French Cavalry, whose ranks were now thoroughly disordered, and
their numbers greatly diminished, by their perseverance in a contest
the hopelessness of which began to appear but too evident.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>During that part of the Battle just described, <span class="smcap">Ney</span> received a
further despatch from the Emperor by Colonel <span class="smcap">Forbin Janson</span>.
It was dated a quarter past three, and announced to the Marshal that
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> was at that moment seriously engaged. It desired
<span class="smcap">Ney</span> to man&oelig;uvre immediately so as to turn the Right of
the Prussians and fall upon their Rear, and contained the remark that
the latter would thus be taken <i>en flagrant délit</i> at the moment
they might be endeavouring to join the English. The impossibility of
<span class="smcap">Ney</span>'s complying with these directions was already sufficiently
apparent.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At this time, <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> received an addition to his forces
by the arrival of the 1st and 3rd Brunswick Light Battalions, and the
Brunswick Brigade of Artillery under Major <span class="smcap">Mahn</span>, consisting
of a Battery of Horse, and another of Foot, Artillery. The guns were
immediately posted close upon the Namur road, at a short distance to
the left of Quatre Bras; and their fire, combined with that of the
British and German Batteries, soon produced a very perceptible effect
upon the French Artillery. The Infantry reinforced the 1st and 3rd
Brunswick Line Battalions occupying the houses of Quatre Bras.</p>

<p>The most important reinforcement, however, was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> arrival, at nearly
the same moment&mdash;about half past six o'clock&mdash;of the First British
Division, under Major General <span class="smcap">Cooke</span>, consisting of the First
Brigade of Guards, commanded by Major General <span class="smcap">Maitland</span>, and
the Second Brigade of Guards, commanded by Major General Sir <span class="smcap">John
Byng</span>.</p>

<p>Their line of march having been by the Nivelles road, they came very
opportunely upon the most critical point of the Anglo-Allied position,
namely, its extreme Right, just at the moment when the French Light
Troops, having driven out the Dutch-Belgian Infantry, showed themselves
in force along the northern boundary of the Wood of Bossu, and some of
their Skirmishers had almost gained the high road.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s force was still further augmented by the recently
arrived troops as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Prince of <span class="smcap">Orange</span>, who had galloped along this road to meet
the Guards, immediately ordered the Light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> Companies under Lieutenant
Colonel Lord <span class="smcap">Saltoun</span>, to enter the Wood. They rushed forward
with a loud cheer, and commenced a brisk fire on their opponents,
who were soon made sensible of the superior description of force now
brought against them. The remainder of the Brigade speedily followed,
and the loud, sharp, animated rattle of musketry, which was progressing
rapidly into the very heart of the Wood, plainly indicated that even in
this quarter, where the French had hitherto been the most successful,
and whence they might not only have molested the Anglo-Allied troops on
the eastern boundary of the Wood, but have most seriously endangered
the Right of the British position, they were now encountering a most
vigorous and determined resistance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Halkett</span>'s Brigade, with the Brunswickers, resolutely
maintained the ground on which they had been charged by the French
Cavalry. As the latter retired, the Light Companies of the Brigade,
with a portion of the Brunswickers on the right, and some Hanoverian
Riflemen on the left, advanced in pursuit. The French threw forward a
line of <i>Tirailleurs</i> to check them, and a brisk fire was maintained
on both sides. The cannonade on this side of the field was also kept
up with great spirit. At length the French Cavalry advanced, forcing
back <span class="smcap">Halkett</span>'s Skirmishers upon their respective Columns,
on which they then charged. Their attack, however, was not made with
much energy, and, upon their being uniformly repulsed, the Light
Troops resumed their former ground. <span class="smcap">Halkett</span> pushed forward
his Battalions to the line of his Skirmishers, and then moving towards
his right, in the direction of the ravine, which descends from the
Wood, drove across the rivulet a body of French Infantry, from which a
portion of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> Brigade had suffered a severe fire. In this part of the
affair one of <span class="smcap">Picton</span>'s Battalions&mdash;the Royals&mdash;co-operated.
The two Brunswick Battalions continued boldly to advance even beyond
this line, resting their right close upon the Wood.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the meantime, <span class="smcap">Byng</span>'s Brigade had closely followed up
<span class="smcap">Maitland</span>'s in support, having previously sent forward its
Light Companies under Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Macdonell</span> round by
Quatre Bras, skirting the eastern border of the Wood. The spirited and
determined nature of the advance of the British Guards not admitting of
that restraint which, considering the many intricate parts of the Wood,
was essential for the preservation of order, led to great confusion
in their ranks by the time they reached the southern extremity, after
having fairly driven out the French; and in this state they ventured to
pursue the Enemy on the open ground, but were quickly repulsed by his
Reserves; and the French Artillery poured so destructive a fire into
this portion of the Wood, that <span class="smcap">Maitland</span> deemed it advisable
to withdraw the 2nd Battalion (under Colonel <span class="smcap">Askew</span>) to the
rivulet, where it was immediately joined from the rear by the other
Battalion of his Brigade (the 3rd, under Colonel the Hon. <span class="smcap">William
Stuart</span>).</p>

<p>The time which would have been occupied in restoring the order and
regularity that had been so completely lost during the progress of
these Battalions through the Wood, was considered too precious for
that purpose at such a moment, and the Brigade was ordered to form
line to its left, outside the Wood, the men falling in promiscuously
as fast as they emerged from their cover, and extending the line into
the plain between the Wood and the Brussels road. Thus formed, the line
advanced, though but for a short distance, when it opened and continued
a brisk fire, under which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> French Infantry, in its immediate
front, deployed with the utmost steadiness and gallantry. This advance
had been followed by the Brunswick Guard Battalion, which was now
man&oelig;uvring to form on the left of <span class="smcap">Maitland</span>'s Brigade.</p>

<p>The French Cavalry, which had been watching for an opportunity to
charge the Brigade, now made a dash at its Left Flank. When the
irregular formation of the latter, which has been already explained,
is considered, it is evident that any attempt to form Square at
that moment would have involved the British Guards in inextricable
confusion, and have rendered them an easy prey to the French horsemen.
Rapid as was the advance of the latter, its object was frustrated
in a manner which testifies the extraordinary discipline of the men
of that Brigade. Mere discipline it was not; it was an instinctive
momentary impulse, which seemed to animate the whole Corps with the
sole conviction, that the only step to be taken, the only chance left
for safety, consisted in a general and instantaneous movement to the
ditch which bounded the Wood on their right. This was accomplished
with complete success, and the French Cavalry, which had advanced in
full confidence of an easy triumph, were hurled back in confusion by a
volley from the ditch, which the Brigade had lined with a rapidity, a
dexterity, and a precision, quite wonderful; while at the same moment,
the Brunswick Battalion threw itself into Square, and received the
Cavalry with a degree of coolness, steadiness, and gallantry, which
won for it the warmest admiration and encomiums of the British who
witnessed the man&oelig;uvre. The flanking fire which was thus brought to
bear so suddenly on the French Cavalry by the Brunswickers, and the
destructive front fire so deliberately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> poured in amongst them by the
British Guards from the ditch, fairly drove them out of this part of
the Field.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>More to the left, the French were retiring before <span class="smcap">Halkett</span>
in perfect order, covered by their Skirmishers. As that General's
Brigade neared the Farm House of Gemioncourt, Major <span class="smcap">Chambers</span>
of the 36th Regiment, an experienced Officer, incited by the desire of
capturing a Post which had been throughout the day a <i>point d'appui</i> to
the French Centre, led on two Companies of his Corps towards it. They
made a gallant rush into the courtyard, but were met by a smart fire
which forced them back. Major <span class="smcap">Chambers</span>, however, rallied his
men in the orchard; and having instructed them how to proceed in their
attack, the place was instantly carried.</p>

<p>The further advance upon the Anglo-Allied Left had, in the meantime,
kept equal pace with that on the Right. <span class="smcap">Ney</span> had been compelled
to yield the strongholds by aid of which he had hoped to force the
Duke's position: his Infantry had been driven out of Piermont and the
inclosures in front of his Right, as also out of the Wood of Bossu on
his Left: Gemioncourt, also, in front of his Centre, had been captured;
while the plain between the two positions, over which his Cavalry
had executed innumerable charges&mdash;charges that were occasionally
suspended merely that the scattered bands might rally afresh to renew
the onslaught with redoubled vigour, and that his Artillery might pour
upon the devoted Squares its destructive missiles, by which each was
shattered to its very centre,&mdash;was now completely cleared from the
presence of a single horseman.</p>

<p>It was long after sunset, and darkness was sensibly approaching, when
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, now that his Flanks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> Centre were relieved,
in the manner already described, from the severity of a pressure of
such long duration, led forward his victorious troops to the foot of
the French position. The loud shouts which proclaimed the triumphant
advance of his forces on either Flank were enthusiastically caught up
and responded to by those who constituted the main central line, and
who had so nobly and so resolutely withstood and defied the impetuous
battle shock by which they had been so repeatedly and so pertinaciously
assailed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ney</span>, convinced of the utter futility, if not imminent hazard,
of protracting the contest, withdrew the whole of his forces, and
concentrated them on the Heights of Frasne, throwing out a strong line
of Picquets, to which <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> opposed a corresponding
line, having the southern extremity of the Wood of Bossu on the Right,
the inclosures south of Piermont on the Left, and Gemioncourt in the
Centre, for its main Supports.</p>

<p>The French Picquets manifested an extraordinary degree of vigilance;
the slightest movement on the side of the Anglo-Allied Picquets
instantly attracted attention, and was noticed by a concentrated fire
from the watchful Sentries of the Enemy. No movement, however, of any
consequence was made on either side during the night. The wearied
combatants sought that rest of which they stood so much in need, and
the silence in which the Anglo-Allied bivouac soon became hushed, was
only disturbed by the arrival of additional reinforcements, consisting
principally of British Cavalry.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Ney</span> was joined by the First Corps, after the termination of
the action. At nine o'clock, <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span> presented himself to the
Marshal for the purpose of reporting to him his proceedings, and of
receiving his Orders, after which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> Corps was bivouacked in the
rear of Frasne; with the exception, however, of <span class="smcap">Durutte</span>'s
Division (the Fourth), and <span class="smcap">Jaquinot</span>'s Light Cavalry Brigade,
which <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span> had left on the Field of Ligny; in front of
the extreme Right of the Prussian Army; a measure which he had deemed
advisable in order to prevent the Enemy from debouching into the plain
between Bry and the Wood of Delhutte.</p>

<span class="smcap">Battle of
Quatre Bras</span>
at 8 o'clock, p.m.
</p>

<p>It is singular that <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, who at Fleurus held so powerful
a Reserve as that consisting of the Imperial Guard and the Sixth Corps,
and who was in perfect ignorance of the true state of affairs at Quatre
Bras, should have ventured to withdraw from <span class="smcap">Ney</span> a force
amounting to more than one half of that which he had originally placed
at his disposal. It was decidedly a false step, from which no advantage
resulted on his own Field of Battle, whilst there can be very little
doubt that it lost him that of Quatre Bras.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The losses sustained in this Battle by the Anglo-Allied Army in killed,
wounded, and missing, were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="losses" width="25%">

<p>To these must be added the loss of the Dutch-Belgian troops, amounting
probably to about 1,000 killed and wounded, which makes the entire loss
of the Anglo-Allied Army equal to about 4,463 men.</p>

<p>The French loss amounted to about 4,000 killed, wounded, and missing.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such was the Battle of Quatre Bras: a battle in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> the British,
the Hanoverian, and the Brunswick, Infantry, covered itself with
imperishable glory; to estimate the full extent of which we must
constantly bear in mind, that the whole brunt of the action fell upon
that Infantry; that throughout the greater part of the day it was
totally unaided by any Cavalry, that Arm of the Allies in the field
having, at the outset, proved itself incompetent to engage with the
French; and, lastly, that it was completely abandoned in the latter
part of the action by the Second Dutch-Belgian Infantry Division,
amounting to no less than 7,533 men.</p>

<p>When the imagination dwells upon that which constitutes one of the
most prominent features of the Battle&mdash;the manner in which the gallant
<span class="smcap">Picton</span>, on finding there was no Cavalry at hand wherewith to
charge effectively that of the Enemy, led on the British Infantry,
and dashed into the midst of the French masses, stoutly maintaining
his ground in defiance of their oft repeated assaults, invariably
scattering back their charging Squadrons in confusion, and this,
too, in the face of a splendid Cavalry, animated by the best spirit,
and headed by a <span class="smcap">Kellermann</span>, whose fame and merit were so
universally acknowledged&mdash;with what exulting pride and heartfelt
gratitude must not the British nation reflect on the heroic valour
displayed by her sons in their noble fulfilment of the desires and
expectations of her Cambrian Chief!</p>

<p>The zealous and cordial support which the Hanoverians and the
Brunswickers afforded to their British brethren in arms, the devotion
with which they commingled with them in the thickest of the fight, are
indelibly engraven in the grateful memory of every true German, and
remain recorded as a lasting theme of admiration in the history of
their fatherland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>The defeat sustained by the French was certainly not attributable,
in the slightest degree, to any deficiency on their part, of either
bravery or discipline. Their deportment was that of truly gallant
soldiers, and their attacks were all conducted with a chivalric
impetuosity, and an admirably sustained vigour, which could leave no
doubt on the minds of their opponents as to the sincerity of their
devotion to the cause of the Emperor.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In a strategical point of view, both parties gained certain important
advantages, and lost others which had been comprised within their
respective plans of operation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ney</span> had succeeded in preventing the junction of the
Anglo-Allied Army with the Prussians, and might have obtained still
more important results, had he not been deprived of the services of
<span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s Corps, the arrival of which he had been so fully led
to expect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, though he had been compelled to relinquish all
hope of being enabled to afford that aid to <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> which,
in the morning, he had proffered to him, yet, by maintaining his
ground at Quatre Bras sufficiently long to admit of the arrival of
reinforcements which enabled him to obtain a brilliant victory, he
completely succeeded in frustrating the grand object of <span class="smcap">Ney</span>'s
movements, which had been to defeat the Anglo-Allied troops thus
advancing, in detail, and also to operate upon <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s
Right Flank. The Duke's success gave ample and convincing evidence of
the sagacity and foresight with which his plans had been devised and
matured, as also of the soundness of those calculations by which he had
for some time previously placed himself, with the confident security
of a master of his art, in a posture of defence, fully prepared to
meet every emergency, from whatever point, or however suddenly, the
coming storm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> might arise. And now that he had gained the Battle, and
secured the important point of Quatre Bras, upon which the remainder
of his troops were advancing, and where the greater portion of them
would arrive in the evening and during the night, he was perfectly
ready and willing, should the Prussians prove victorious at Ligny, to
renew the contest on the following morning, by attacking <span class="smcap">Ney</span>
with his collected force; and then, if successful (of which little
doubt could be entertained), by a junction with <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s
Right, to operate upon <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s Left, so as to bring the
great mass of the combined Armies to bear directly upon the main body
of the French; or, in case of a defeat of the Prussians, to make good
his retreat along his principal line of operation, in such a manner,
as to secure a position between Quatre Bras and Brussels, favourable
for a co-operation of <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s forces with his own, and for
presenting a bold and determined stand against the further advance of
the French Emperor.</p>

<p>Orders were now forwarded for the movement of <span class="smcap">Clinton</span>'s
Division on the following morning, at daybreak, from Nivelles to Quatre
Bras: and of <span class="smcap">Colville</span>'s Division, at the same hour, from
Enghien to Nivelles. The Reserve Artillery was directed to move at
daybreak, on the following morning, to Quatre Bras, there to receive
further orders; and the Tenth Infantry Brigade, under Major General Sir
<span class="smcap">John Lambert</span>, was directed to march, at the same hour, from
Assche to Genappe, there to remain until further orders.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The tremendous roar of Artillery in the direction of Ligny gave a
sufficient intimation to the Duke that a great Battle had taken place
in that quarter, but as it seemed to continue stationary, and only
ceased as night set in, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> doubtful of the result, and remained
in this state of suspense and uncertainty until the following morning;
the Officer who had been despatched in the night to Quatre Bras from
the Prussian Head Quarters with the expected communication, having been
surprised in the dark, and made a prisoner by the French.</p>

<p class="drop">PRINCE BLÜCHER having ascertained, on the morning of the 16th,
that his communication with the Left Division of the Duke of
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s forces by Quatre Bras continued uninterrupted,
resolved upon accepting battle in the position in rear of Fleurus,
which had been previously fixed upon as the one most eligible, in the
event of the Enemy's adoption of that line of operations respecting
which all doubt and uncertainty had now ceased. Its importance in a
strategical point of view, apart from tactical considerations, was
manifest. <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> having, on his part, selected Quatre
Bras as the point whereon to concentrate his forces, the position in
question, connected as it was with the latter by a paved road over an
extent of not more than six or seven miles, offered great facility for
co-operation and mutual support upon whichever point the great mass of
the French Army might be directed.</p>

<p>Should it prove tenable, then, considered in conjunction with the
advance of the Russians from the Rhine, the whole line of the Meuse
below Namur, and the communications with Aix la Chapelle and the
Prussian States, were effectually secured. If, on the other hand,
either position should be forced by the Enemy, then Mont St Jean and
Wavre, upon parallel lines of retreat towards Brussels and Louvain,
would likewise offer the means of co-operation on the south side of the
Forest of Soignies; and supposing <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> willing to risk for
a time his communication with the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> bank of the Meuse, concentric
lines of retreat upon Brussels would bring the two Armies in combined
position in the immediate front of that capital.</p>

<p>Supposing also that <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s plan had been to advance by
Mons, the concentration of the Prussian forces could not have been
effected upon a more favourable point than that of Sombref, whence
they could have advanced in support of their Allies, leaving a
sufficient portion of <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Corps to watch the approaches
by Charleroi: and, finally, had the French Emperor directed his main
attack by Namur, the retreat of <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s Corps would have
secured time for effecting the concentration of the First, Second,
and Third Prussian <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, if not also of the Fourth, while
the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s forces might have assembled at
Quatre Bras, for the purpose of meeting any secondary attack from the
Charleroi side, and of forming a junction with the Prussian Army.</p>

<p>The position itself comprises the Heights of Bry, Sombref, and
Tongrines, contiguous to the high road connecting Namur with Nivelles,
by Quatre Bras, and to the point of junction of that road with the
one from Charleroi, by Fleurus. These Heights are bounded upon the
south-west and western sides, or right of the position, by a ravine,
through which winds a small rivulet along the Villages of Wagnelé,
St Amand la Haye, and St Amand, near the lower end of which last, it
unites with the greater rivulet of the Ligny; and, along the whole
of the south side, or front of the position, by a valley, through
which flows the Ligny, and in which lie, partly bordering the stream
itself, and partly covering the declivities, the Villages of Ligny,
Mont Potriaux, Tongrenelles, Boignée, Balatre, and Vilrets. At the last
named point, another small rivulet falls into the Ligny on quitting
a deep ravine, which commences northward of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> Village of Botey,
and thus tends to the security of the extreme Left of the position.
The extreme Right, however, resting upon the Namur road, in the
direction of Quatre Bras, was completely <i>en l'air</i>. The Heights in
rear of St Amand, Ligny, and Sombref, are somewhat lower than those on
the opposite or Fleurus side of the valley; and, from the nature of
the ground, troops, particularly Artillery, are more exposed on the
former than on the latter, where the undulations afford better cover.
The descent from either side into the Villages of Wagnelé, St Amand
la Haye, and St Amand, is gentle: between the latter point and Mont
Potriaux the sides of the valley descend more rapidly: and below that
Village they become steep, particularly about Tongrines, Boignée, and
Balatre: while the ground above commands alternately from side to side.
Above Mont Potriaux, the bed of the valley is soft, and occasionally
swampy: below that point it partakes still more of this character.
The buildings in the Villages are generally of stone, with thatched
roofs, and comprise several farm houses with courtyards, presenting
great capabilities for defence. St Amand and Boignée are the most
salient points of the position, the central portion of which retires
considerably, particularly near Mont Potriaux.</p>

<p>In the morning of the 16th, the First Corps (<span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s)
occupied that portion of the position which is circumscribed by the
Villages of Bry, St Amand la Haye, St Amand, and Ligny. The four
Brigades of this Corps had been very much mixed up together when
occupying these Villages during the night, which will account in some
measure for the promiscuous manner in which their several Battalions
appear to have been distributed during the Battle. The main body of
the Corps was drawn up on the Height between Bry and Ligny, and upon
which stands the Farm and Windmill of Bussy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> the highest point of
the whole position. Seven Battalions of the Second Brigade (General
<span class="smcap">Pirch II.</span>) were formed immediately in rear of this Farm; the
28th Regiment and 2nd Westphalian Landwehr in the First, and the 2nd
and 3rd Battalions of the 6th Regiment in the Second, Line; while
the 3rd Battalion of the latter Regiment occupied the Farm itself,
which was put into a state of defence. Two Battalions of the Fourth
Brigade (General Count <span class="smcap">Henkel</span>), namely, the 2nd Battalions
of the 19th Regiment and of the 4th Westphalian Landwehr, stood on
the slope between the Second Brigade and Ligny; while the remaining
four Battalions of the Brigade&mdash;the 1st and 3rd of the 19th Regiment,
and the 1st and 3rd of the 4th Westphalian Landwehr&mdash;were charged
with the defence of Ligny. The Village of Bry was occupied by the 3rd
Battalions of the 12th and 24th Regiments, belonging to the First
Brigade (General <span class="smcap">Steinmetz</span>); and the 2nd Battalion of the 1st
Westphalian Landwehr was posted in rear of the Village in support.
The 1st and 3rd Companies of the Silesian Rifles, attached to this
Brigade, were distributed about the intersected ground between Bry and
St Amand la Haye. The remainder of the First Brigade was posted on the
Height in the rear of St Amand, its Right resting on St Amand la Haye;
the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 12th Regiment on the right, and the
1st and 2nd Battalions of the 24th Regiment on the left, forming a
First, and the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the 1st Westphalian Landwehr
forming a Second, Line. The defence of St Amand was confided to three
Battalions of the Third Brigade (General <span class="smcap">Jagow</span>)&mdash;the 1st and
2nd of the 29th Regiment, and the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Westphalian
Landwehr. The remaining six Battalions of this Brigade were posted in
reserve northward of Ligny, and near the Bois du Loup. The 2nd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> and 4th
Companies of the Silesian Rifles were thrown into Ligny. The Reserve
Cavalry of <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Corps continued in advance, upon the
Fleurus high road, watching the movements of the Enemy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was eight o'clock when these dispositions were completed; and
about eleven o'clock, <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s Corps, which more than an hour
before had quitted its bivouac near Mazy, was formed up in reserve to
<span class="smcap">Zieten</span>. The Fifth Brigade (General <span class="smcap">Tippelskirchen</span>)
stood across the high road, near its intersection with the old Roman
road, in the customary Prussian Brigade order of three lines of Columns
of Battalions at deploying intervals, and had in its front the two
Batteries, Nos. 10 and 37. The Sixth Brigade (General <span class="smcap">Krafft</span>)
was posted in similar order in the rear of the Farm of Bussy, and in
left rear of Bry. The Seventh Brigade (General <span class="smcap">Brause</span>) stood
more to the left: it had only the 14th Regiment then present, for the
22nd Regiment and the Elbe Landwehr did not rejoin it until one o'clock
in the afternoon. The Eighth Brigade (Colonel <span class="smcap">Langen</span>) was
ordered to remain upon the high road leading from Sombref to Fleurus,
until the arrival of the Third Corps (<span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s). One of
its Battalions&mdash;the 3rd of the 21st Regiment&mdash;as also two Squadrons of
the Neumark Dragoons attached to this Corps, had been left in the line
of Outposts beyond the Meuse, towards Philippeville; and did not rejoin
it until the 20th of June.</p>

<p>The Reserve Cavalry of <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s Corps, under General
<span class="smcap">Jürgass</span>, was stationed in rear of the high road, and on the
west side of Sombref.</p>

<p>The twelve pounder Batteries, Nos. 4 and 8, and the Horse Batteries,
Nos. 5 and 18, remained in reserve, near Sombref.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s Corps, which had quitted Namur about seven
o'clock in the morning, had reached Sombref before twelve. It was
immediately assigned its position in that part of the Field which lies
between Sombref and Balatre, and was posted in Columns upon both high
roads, here to remain available for either a movement to the right, or
for the occupation of the position in Left Front of Sombref, along the
Heights in rear of the Ligny rivulet.</p>

<p>Such were the dispositions made by <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> previously to
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s advancing from Fleurus. The occupation of Ligny and
St Amand&mdash;the most salient part of the position&mdash;by <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s
Corps, and the posting of the Reserve Cavalry of the latter in the
intervening space between those Villages and Fleurus, were justly
calculated to secure for the Prussian Commander ample time for further
developing his Line of Battle in such a manner as the direction and
mode of his opponent's attack might render most expedient.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the morning of the 16th, the French troops which lay along the
Sambre, and which belonged to that main portion of the Army which was
more immediately under the orders and guidance of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>,
quitted their bivouacs, and marched to join their leading Columns,
the position of which in front of Fleurus was described in the Fourth
Chapter.</p>

<p>It was past ten o'clock when these troops debouched in two Columns from
the Fleurus Wood&mdash;the one along the High road, the other more to the
right&mdash;and drew up in two lines within a short distance of Fleurus. In
the First Line <span class="smcap">Pajol</span>'s Light, and <span class="smcap">Excelmans</span>' Heavy,
Cavalry, formed the Right, and <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>'s Corps, the Left,
Wing; while <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>'s Corps which had not received the Order to
march until half past nine o'clock, arrived much later, and occupied
the Centre. <span class="smcap">Girard</span>'s Division was detached some little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
distance on the extreme Left. The Imperial Guard and <span class="smcap">Milhaud</span>'s
Corps of <i>Cuirassiers</i> constituted the Second Line. More than an hour
was passed in this position before the arrival of the Emperor, who
then rode along the line of Vedettes, and reconnoitred the Enemy's
dispositions.</p>

<p>It appeared to <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> that <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> had taken up
a position perpendicular to the Namur road, and had, in this way,
completely exposed his Right Flank; whence he inferred that the Prince
placed great reliance upon the arrival of auxiliary forces from the
Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Army.</p>

<p>A single glance at the Prussian position, as it has been described,
will suffice to prove that the French Emperor was in error as
regarded <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s assumed Line of Battle, and that so
far from its having been perpendicular to, it was, in the general
military acceptation of the term, parallel with, the Namur road. At
the same time it is proper to remark, that he may have been misled
by the massing of the Prussian troops between the salient point of
the position, St Amand, and the road in question, as well as by the
direction of the line of the occupied Villages of St Amand, Ligny,
and Sombref. It must also be acknowledged that although the inference
was incorrectly drawn, it accorded in substance with the real fact,
that <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> did rely upon the arrival of a portion of
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s forces by the Namur road from Quatre Bras.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> having returned from his reconnaissance, immediately
gave his Orders for the advance of the Army, and for the disposition of
each individual Corps in his intended Line of Battle.</p>

<p>Impressed with the important advantage which, according to his assumed
view of <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s position, might accrue from a vigorous
and well timed attack upon the Right and Rear of the Prussians,
while vigorously assailing them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span> himself in their Front, he directed
<span class="smcap">Soult</span> to address to <span class="smcap">Ney</span> the despatch, dated two
o'clock, to which reference was made in the preceding Chapter,
acquainting the Marshal that in half an hour thence he proposed
attacking <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, posted between Sombref and Bry, and
desiring that he would, on his part, also attack whatever might be in
his front, and that after having vigorously repulsed the Enemy, he
should move towards the Emperor's Field of Battle, and fall upon the
Right and Rear of the Prussians; adding, at the same time, that should
the Emperor be first successful, he would then move to the support of
the Army at Quatre Bras.</p>

<p>The French Light Troops moved forward against Fleurus, of which place
they gained possession between eleven and twelve o'clock, and then
opened from their Light Artillery a cannonade upon the Prussian Cavalry
Posts taken up by the 6th Uhlans. The latter immediately retired,
and formed upon the left of the Brandenburg Dragoons, which Regiment
had been placed in front of the Tombe de Ligny, along with the Horse
Battery No. 2, in support. The Brandenburg Uhlans were also in support,
but more to the rear, and on the left of the high road.</p>

<p>At this time, <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> was on the Height of Fleurus, again
reconnoitring the Prussian position; and it was also about the same
period that <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> joined <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> in person near
the Mill of Bussy.</p>

<p>As soon as <span class="smcap">Röder</span> perceived the imposing array of the French
Columns in full advance, he ordered the immediate retreat of his
Cavalry, which he covered with the 6th Uhlans and the Brandenburg
Dragoons, together with two pieces of Horse Artillery. He sent the
main body, which he had stationed in a hollow, in rear of the Tombe de
Ligny, as also the remainder of the Artillery, across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> Ligny, with
directions to take post between the Village of that name and Sombref.
He himself continued with the above two Regiments, and the two guns,
near the Tombe de Ligny, until he received Orders also to retire.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the mean time, the main body of the French Army advanced in great
regularity in Columns of Corps. The Left Column, consisting of the
Third <i>Corps d'Armée</i> under <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>, to which was attached
the Infantry Division under Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">Girard</span>
belonging to <span class="smcap">Reille</span>'s Corps (then with <span class="smcap">Ney</span>), being
destined to advance against St Amand, the most salient point of the
Prussian position, and therefore having the shortest distance to pass
over, was the first to take up its ground, preparatory to attack.
Whilst thus engaged in making its preliminary dispositions for this
purpose, it was cannonaded by the Prussian Batteries posted on the
Heights in rear of the Village. <span class="smcap">Girard</span>'s Division took post
on the left of <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>'s Corps, and <span class="smcap">Domon</span>'s Light
Cavalry Division on the left of <span class="smcap">Girard</span>.</p>

<p>The Centre Column, consisting of the Fourth <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, under
<span class="smcap">Gérard</span>, advanced along the Fleurus high road, and took up,
somewhat later, a position upon the Heights fronting Ligny, and
parallel to the general direction of that Village; its Left being near
the Tombe de Ligny, and its Right resting on an eminence southward of
Mont Potriaux.</p>

<p>The Right Column, under <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>, comprising the Cavalry Corps
of <span class="smcap">Pajol</span> and <span class="smcap">Excelmans</span>, moved by its right, and
took post, as did also the Light Cavalry Division under Lieutenant
General <span class="smcap">Maurin</span>, belonging to the Fourth <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, on
the right of <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>, and showing front towards the Villages
of Tongrines, Tongrenelle, Boignée, and Balatre.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>
disposed this Cavalry so as to protect <span class="smcap">Gérard</span> from any
attempt which the Prussians might make to debouch in his rear from
Mont Potriaux or Tongrenelle; as also to watch any hostile movements
on their Left, and to divert their attention from the Centre.
<span class="smcap">Pajol</span>'s Corps, which was formed on the Right, detached along
the cross road which leads to Namur. The Villages of Boignée and
Balatre being situated on the French side of the valley, and occupied
by Prussian Infantry, <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> was supplied with two Battalions
from <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>'s Corps. The 1st and 2nd Squadrons of the 3rd
Kurmark Landwehr Cavalry belonging to <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s Corps,
which had been posted in advance, upon the Fleurus road, retired
skirmishing until they reached the barrier at the Bridge, whither
they were pursued by the French Cavalry. Here, however, the latter
were checked and driven off by the 3rd Battalion of the 4th Kurmark
Landwehr, belonging to Colonel Luck's Brigade.</p>

<p>The Imperial Guard and <span class="smcap">Milhaud</span>'s <i>Cuirassiers</i> were halted
in reserve, the former on the left, and the latter on the right, of
Fleurus.</p>

<p>As soon as the direction of the Enemy's movements for attack became
sufficiently manifest, <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> made such further disposition
of his force as appeared to him requisite to meet that attack.</p>

<p>He ordered the Batteries of the First <i>Corps d'Armée</i>
(<span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s) to be suitably posted for impeding the Enemy's
advance. The three Heavy Batteries of the Corps were immediately drawn
up on the Height between Ligny and St Amand. They were supported by
the Battery of the First Brigade, posted in rear of St Amand. Somewhat
later, when the direction of attack by <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>'s Corps became
more developed, the Battery of the Third Brigade was placed on the
right of Ligny, near a quarry, and the Battery of the Fourth Brigade on
the left of the Village, upon the declivity descending to the rivulet.
The Battery of the Second Brigade, the Foot Battery No. 1, and the
Horse Battery No. 10, remained in reserve. Of the remaining Horse
Batteries of the Corps, one continued with the Cavalry under General
<span class="smcap">Röder</span> (which was posted in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> hollow, as before stated,
between Ligny and Sombref), and the other was with the 1st Silesian
Hussars, which Regiment had been detached in observation on the Right
Flank of the Army, and posted between the northern extremity of the
village of Wagnelé and a large pond contiguous to the old Roman road.</p>

<p>By the time the action commenced in front of St Amand and Ligny&mdash;half
past two o'clock&mdash;<span class="smcap">Blücher</span> was satisfied that no necessity
existed for any movement of his Third <i>Corps d'Armée</i> to the right; and
he therefore ordered it to proceed from the position it had hitherto
held in Columns upon the two high roads near Sombref, and form the
Left Wing of his line of battle; resting its Right upon Sombref, and
occupying the Heights, at the foot and on the declivities of which
are situated the Villages of Mont Potriaux, Tongrines, Tongrenelle,
Boignée, Balatre, Vilrets, and Botey.</p>

<p>The Ninth Brigade (General <span class="smcap">Borke</span>) was formed in Brigade
order in rear of Sombref and northward of the Namur high road, having
detached one of its Battalions (the 3rd of the 8th Regiment) with the
Foot Battery No. 18, to Mont Potriaux, where the former posted itself
on the north, and the latter took up a favourable position on the
south, side of the Church. The Eleventh Brigade (Colonel <span class="smcap">Luck</span>)
with the twelve pounder Battery No. 7, stood across the Fleurus high
road, in front of the junction of the latter with the Namur road upon
the Height of Le Point du Jour, having detached the 3rd Battalion
of the 4th Kurmark Landwehr into the valley, where it occupied the
houses in its immediate vicinity. Four Battalions of the Tenth Brigade
(Colonel <span class="smcap">Kämpfen</span>) were drawn up on the Height of Tongrines,
resting their Right on this Village, and having in their front the
Foot Battery No. 35, and at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span> short distance from their Left, the
Horse Battery No. 18. The remaining two Battalions of the Brigade
were detached, the 3rd Battalion of the 27th Regiment, to occupy
Tongrines and the Castle of Tongrenelle, and the 3rd Battalion of the
2nd Kurmark Landwehr, to hold the Villages of Boignée and Balatre. The
2nd Battalion of the 3rd Kurmark Landwehr, belonging to the Brigade,
as also two Squadrons of the 6th Kurmark Landwehr Cavalry, and two
Squadrons of the 9th Hussars, attached to this Corps, still continued
in the line of Outposts in the vicinity of Dinant, to observe Givet;
and rejoined on the morning of the 17th of June. The Twelfth Brigade
(Colonel <span class="smcap">Stülpnagel</span>) with the Horse Battery No. 20, was formed
in Brigade order, in reserve, near the Windmill, on the Height of
Le Point du Jour. The Reserve Cavalry of this Corps, with the Horse
Battery No. 19, was posted on the extreme Left of the position between
Botey and Vilrets, whence it detached the 3rd Squadron of the 7th
Uhlans to Onoz, in observation.</p>

<p>This position and the order of battle which was thus developed, were
well calculated to answer the object which <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> had in
view, namely, to hold his ground long enough to gain sufficient time
for the arrival of at least a portion of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s forces,
expected to join the Prussian extreme Right by the Namur road; as also,
perhaps, for the arrival and co-operation of <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Corps,
in rear of <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>, by the Gembloux road. In either of
these cases, if not previously favoured by the circumstances of the
general battle about to take place, such a marked accession to his
strength would enable him to assume the offensive; whilst, in the first
mentioned, <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> would effectually prevent a junction
between <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s and <span class="smcap">Ney</span>'s forces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>The position had been long before selected, and the whole of the ground
had even been surveyed, with a view to meet the contingency which
had now actually occurred; but then it must be remembered, that in
this design the co-operation of the Fourth <i>Corps d'Armée</i> was fully
contemplated, whereas the latter had now become a doubtful question:
and hence it was that <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> was led to place more reliance
upon a direct support from <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, than would otherwise
have been the case.</p>

<p>To accept a battle, notwithstanding the absence of <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s
Corps, was undoubtedly the wisest course. The Enemy's force in the
field did not appear to exceed that of the Prussians; and therefore,
considering the nature of the position, the contest would, in
all probability, become protracted, perhaps until the arrival of
<span class="smcap">Bülow</span>; perhaps, also, until the close of day, without any
distinct advantage being gained by either party. In the former case,
the required preponderance might instantly give a decidedly favourable
turn to the scale; in the latter, the junction of the Fourth Corps
during the night would enable <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> on the following
morning to attack his opponent with every prospect of success, and
either to relieve <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, if necessary, from any pressure
in his front, or so to combine his further operations with those of
the British Commander, should the latter have held his ground and
concentrated his Army, as to lead to the complete overthrow of both
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s and <span class="smcap">Ney</span>'s forces.</p>

<p>To have declined the contest, and retired so as to effect a junction
with his Fourth Corps, he must still, if he wished to act in
close concert with <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, have abandoned his direct
communication with the Meuse and the Rhine, whence he drew all his
supplies; a result which might as well be trusted to the chances of a
battle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>These considerations were also, in all probability, strongly seconded
by a desire on the part of the Prussian Commander, and one perfectly in
keeping with his ardent character, to take every possible measure which
was at all warranted by the actual posture of affairs, for vigorously
opposing <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s advance.</p>

<p>In a tactical point of view, the position was undoubtedly defective.
Nearly the entire of the ground situated between the line of Villages
of Ligny, St Amand, and Wagnelé, and the great Namur road, was
exposed to the view of the Enemy; and as there was every probability
of a protracted village fight along the front of the position, the
Supports and Reserves required to maintain a contest of that nature,
would necessarily be subjected to the full play of the Batteries on
the opposite heights. Upon the space above mentioned every movement
could be detected from the French side; where, on the contrary, the
undulations were such as to admit of the concealment of the disposition
of considerable masses of troops. The defect in this respect was
subsequently made strikingly manifest by the fact that the gradual
weakening of the Prussian Centre for the purpose of reinforcing the
Right, was closely observed by <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, who took advantage of
the insight thus obtained into his opponent's designs, by collecting in
rear of the Heights of Ligny that force with which, when he saw that
the Prussians had no Reserve remaining, he so suddenly assailed and
broke the Centre of their line.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s dispositions having been completed, the Battle
commenced, about half past two o'clock, with an attack upon the
Village of St Amand, by Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">Lefol</span>'s Division
of <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>'s Corps. The attack, which was made in three
Columns, proved successful; the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span> Battalions of the 29th Prussian
Regiment which defended it, were compelled, after a stout resistance,
to yield to greatly superior numbers, and were driven out of the
Village. General <span class="smcap">Steinmetz</span>, whose Brigade was posted in rear
of St Amand, pushed forward all the Sharpshooters of the 12th and 24th
Regiments to their support.</p>

<p>These, however, being unable to make head against the Enemy, who
already made a disposition to debouch from the village, the 12th and
24th Regiments were led forward to renew the contest. In the mean time,
just as the French appeared at the outlet of the Village, a shower of
grape and canister was poured right down amongst them from the Foot
Battery No. 7. Immediately upon this, both Battalions of the 12th
Regiment descended into the ravine, rushed upon the inclosures, and,
driving the Enemy's shattered Infantry before them, regained possession
of the Village. The 24th Regiment advancing by Wings of Battalions&mdash;the
one in line and the other in column of reserve respectively&mdash;supported
this attack upon the left, and established itself in the lower part of
St Amand.</p>

<p>In the course of this short prelude, the Batteries ranged along the
little eminences which rose on either side of the valley of the Ligny,
opened a furious cannonade along the whole extent of the Front Lines
of the contending Armies. Ligny, as also St Amand (when repossessed by
the Prussians), both of which lay so directly under the French guns,
seemed devoted to destruction. Their defenders, sheltered in a great
degree by stone walls, hollow ways, and banked up hedges, appeared
perfectly motionless while the deluge of shot and shell poured fast and
thick around them; but no sooner did those in Ligny discover a dusky
mass emerging from the clouds of smoke which enveloped the Heights
above them, and wending its course downwards upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span> lower portion
of the Village, than they rushed out of their concealment, and lining
with their advanced Skirmishers the outermost inclosures, prepared to
meet the onset which would probably bring them into closer contact with
their Enemies, and lead to a struggle in which physical strength and
innate courage, combined with individual skill and dexterity, might
effect a result unattainable by a recourse to projectiles alone. It was
the 2nd Battalion of the 19th Prussian Regiment, which, issuing from
its cover, where it had stood in column, rapidly deployed, and, by a
well directed volley, shook the advancing mass, which it then threw
into disorder by following up this advantage with a well sustained fire.</p>

<p>Twice was this attack repeated on the part of <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>'s troops,
but with a similar result. A second Column now advanced against the
centre of the Village, and shortly afterwards a third was launched
against the upper part of it, near the old Castle; but their attempts
to penetrate within its precincts proved equally futile, and the four
Prussian Battalions of <span class="smcap">Henkel</span>'s Brigade gallantly maintained
the post of Ligny. As the French Column withdrew, their Batteries
played with redoubled energy upon the Village, and fresh Columns
prepared for another assault.</p>

<p>The troops of <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>'s Corps renewed the attack upon St
Amand with the utmost vigour; and forcing back the 12th and 24th
Prussian Regiments, which suffered most severely, penetrated into
the Village, where the fight became obstinate, and the fire most
destructive. <span class="smcap">Steinmetz</span> had only two more Battalions of his
Brigade remaining at his disposal&mdash;the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the
1st Westphalian Landwehr&mdash;and these he pushed forward into the Village,
to restore confidence to the defenders, whose numbers were so fearfully
reduced, and, if possible, to stem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> the progress of the assailants.
They had scarcely got fairly into action, however, when their
Commanding Officers were wounded, and both Battalions gave way before
the furious onset of the French, the 3rd Battalion leaving numbers of
its men killed, along the outlets of the Village. The whole Brigade,
which, within a short period, had suffered a loss of 46 Officers and
2,300 men, having rallied in rear of St Amand, retired into position
between Bry and Sombref, and the three Battalions which had first
occupied the Village, marched to rejoin the Third Brigade; whilst the
loud shouts of "<i>Vive l'Empereur!</i>" which immediately followed the
cessation of the sharp rattle of the musketry, heard even amidst the
incessant thunder of the Artillery, proclaimed the triumph of the
French Infantry.</p>

<p>In the meantime, another assault was made upon Ligny, whose
defenders had been reinforced by the two remaining Battalions of
<span class="smcap">Henkel</span>'s Brigade. The French now changed their mode of attack.
They advanced simultaneously against the centre with the view of
gaining the Churchyard, and against the lower end of the Village in
order to turn the Left Flank of the defenders; and taking advantage
of the unusually great height of the corn, their line of Skirmishers,
strengthened by whole Battalions so as to give it a decided superiority
over that of the Prussians, approached so cautiously and silently
as to continue unperceived until they suddenly possessed themselves
of the outermost hedges and gardens. A hand to hand contest ensued,
and the Prussians, pressed in front by superior numbers, and taken
in flank at the same time, were forced to yield. Presently, however,
stimulated by the combined exertions of the Commanding Officers, Majors
Count <span class="smcap">Gröben</span>, <span class="smcap">Kuylenstierna</span>, and <span class="smcap">Rex</span>, they
recovered themselves, rallied, and again faced their Enemies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>The Battle, on this part of the Field, now presented an awfully grand
and animating spectacle, and the hopes of both parties were raised
to the highest state of excitement. Intermingled with the quick but
irregular discharge of small arms throughout the whole extent of the
Village, came forth alternately the cheering "<i>En avant!</i>" and exulting
"<i>Vive l'Empereur!</i>" as also the emphatic "<i>Vorwärts!</i>" and the wild
"<i>Hourrah!</i>" whilst the Batteries along the Heights, continuing their
terrific roar, plunged destruction into the masses seen descending
on either side to join in the desperate struggle in the valley, out
of which there now arose, from the old Castle of Ligny, volumes of
dark thick smoke, succeeded by brilliant flames, imparting additional
sublimity to the scene.</p>

<p>The Prussians gradually gained ground, and then pressing forward upon
all points of the Village, succeeded in clearing it of the French; who,
in retreating, abandoned two guns which had been moved close down to
the principal outlet on that side. General <span class="smcap">Jagow</span>'s Brigade
(the Third) had made a change of front to its left, and approached the
Village; the 3rd Battalions of both the 7th and 29th Regiments had been
detached to the right, to protect the Foot Batteries Nos. 3 and 8, and
to remain in reserve; the four remaining Battalions descended into the
Village as a reinforcement.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Beyond an occasional cannonading, the action on the eastern
side of the Field, between the Corps of <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> and of
<span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>, was comparatively languid: being limited to a
contest, varied in its results, for the possession of the village of
Bognée, and subsequently, of those houses of Tongrines which were
situated along the bottom of the valley; as also to some skilful
man&oelig;uvring on the part of <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> with his Cavalry, with a
view of menacing the Prussian Left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>In the mean time, the French maintained possession of St Amand, but
<span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s twelve pounder Batteries, which were now moved
forward, presented a formidable obstruction to their debouching from
that Village.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> directed General <span class="smcap">Girard</span>, on the extreme
Left, to take possession, with his Division, of St Amand la Haye; and
this operation having been successfully accomplished, gave the French
the advantage of outflanking from thence any attack upon St Amand
itself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blücher</span> ordered General <span class="smcap">Pirch II.</span> to retake this
Village; whereupon the latter advanced with his Brigade from the Height
of Bry, and withdrew the 1st Battalion of the 6th Regiment from the
Windmill of Bussy, which was then occupied by the 2nd Battalion of the
23rd Regiment (Eighth Brigade), and near to which the 1st Westphalian
Landwehr Cavalry remained during the whole of the action.</p>

<p>At the same time, the Prussian Chief, fully sensible of the very
critical position in which he would be placed, were the French,
following up the advantages they had already gained upon his right,
to debouch from St Amand and St Amand la Haye in sufficient force to
overpower <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Corps, and thus cut off his communication
with <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>; he decided upon occupying the Village of
Wagnelé, whence repeated attacks might be directed against the Enemy's
Left Flank; and, with this view, he desired General <span class="smcap">Pirch I.</span>,
who commanded the Second Corps, to detach the Fifth Brigade (General
<span class="smcap">Tippelskirchen</span>'s) to the latter Village, and to place it
under the orders of General <span class="smcap">Jürgass</span>, who was also sent to
that part of the Field, with Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Sohr</span>'s
Brigade of Cavalry (consisting of the 3rd Brandenburg, and 5th
Pomeranian, Hussars), together with two Squadrons of the 6th Neumark
Dragoons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> and the Horse Battery No. 6. Colonel <span class="smcap">Marwitz</span>,
of <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s Corps, was also ordered to join these
troops with two Regiments of his Brigade, the 7th and 8th Uhlans.
The Brigade of General <span class="smcap">Brause</span> (the Seventh), which had been
rejoined by detached Battalions, was pushed forward as far as the
Roman road, to occupy the position vacated by the advance of General
<span class="smcap">Tippelskirchen</span>'s Brigade, to which it was to act as a Support
in case of necessity.</p>

<p>It was four o'clock when General <span class="smcap">Pirch II.</span> who had formed
his Brigade for the attack of St Amand la Haye, having his Left Flank
protected by the 12th Regiment, which had reassembled in rear of St
Amand, moved his Front Line against the former Village. As it advanced,
however, its ranks were dreadfully shattered by the fire from the
French Artillery, nor were they less thinned by that of the musketry
as they entered the Village; and such was the determined resistance
on the part of the French, that they were unable to penetrate beyond
the centre of the Village; and though reinforced by the 1st Battalion
of the 6th Regiment, from the Second Line, they found it quite
impracticable to drive the Enemy out of a Large Building which was
surrounded by a stone wall, and which formed the point of connection
between the two Villages. The Prussians having got into great disorder,
and being closely pressed by the French, were compelled to abandon the
Village, in order to collect their scattered remnants, and to reform.
General <span class="smcap">Girard</span>, whose Division had, under his own immediate
guidance, so gallantly maintained the Village, fell mortally wounded on
this occasion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blücher</span> now decided on a renewed attack upon St Amand la Haye,
in order to occupy the front of <span class="smcap">Girard</span>'s Division, while he
should carry into effect his previously projected movement against
the Enemy's Left Flank; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> anxious to ensure the due execution of
his instructions and to direct the attacks himself, he repaired in
person to this part of the Field. General <span class="smcap">Tippelskirchen</span>'s
Brigade, having advanced along the Roman road, was already formed in
Brigade order, in rear of Wagnelé, while <span class="smcap">Jürgass</span> had posted
his Cavalry more to the left, and opposite to the interval between
that Village and St Amand la Haye, whence he could with considerable
advantage fall upon the Enemy, should the latter venture to debouch in
that direction.</p>

<p>These movements did not escape the watchful eye of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>,
who detached a Division of the Young Guard and a Battery of the same
Corps in support of his Left Wing, as also General <span class="smcap">Colbert</span>'s
Brigade of Lancers from Count <span class="smcap">Pajol</span>'s Corps, to reinforce
the Cavalry on the Left, and to preserve the communication with
<span class="smcap">Ney</span>.</p>

<p>When all was ready for the attack, <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, who felt how much
depended on its result, galloped up to the leading Battalions, and thus
earnestly and impassionately ordered the advance:&mdash;"Now, lads, behave
well! don't suffer the <i>Grande Nation</i> again to rule over you! Forward!
In God's name&mdash;forward!" Instantly his devoted followers rent the air
with their re-echoing shouts of "<i>Vorwärts!</i>"</p>

<p>Nothing could surpass the undaunted resolution and intrepid mien which
<span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s Battalions displayed as they advanced against, and
entered, St Amand la Haye, at a charging pace; they completely swept
the Enemy before them; while Major <span class="smcap">Quadt</span>, who commanded the
28th Regiment, supported by some Detachments of the 2nd Regiment (from
<span class="smcap">Tippelskirchen</span>'s Brigade) gained possession of the great
building. The 1st Battalion of the 6th Regiment, after having forced
its way right across the Village, sallied forth from the opposite
side, in pursuit of the Enemy, with a degree of impetuosity which
its Officers had the utmost difficulty in restraining, while numbers
of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> men were on the point of plunging into the very midst of the
French Reserves. The Cavalry on the right of the Village seemed to
have caught up the intrepid spirit and enthusiastic devotion of the
Infantry; and, as if impatient to join in the struggle, a Squadron
of the Brandenburg Uhlans supported the attack of the Village by a
charge upon the Enemy's Cavalry: after which, the remainder of this
Regiment, with the 1st Kurmark Landwehr Cavalry, advanced under General
<span class="smcap">Treskow</span>, into the plain on the left of the Village, of which
the whole contour now bristled with the bayonets of the 46th Regiment,
while the 28th Regiment held the Post of the Great Building, which it
had so gallantly carried, and the 2nd Westphalian Landwehr stood in
Second Line, as a Reserve.</p>

<p>So completely absorbed was the attention of the twelve pounder Battery
No. 6, which stood in a somewhat isolated position, by the contest in
St Amand la Haye, which it covered by its fire, that it had not noticed
the stealthy advance of a Troop of the Enemy's horsemen, wearing the
uniform of the Light Artillery of the Guard, and most unexpectedly
found itself attacked in flank by these bold adventurers. This give
rise to a curious scene, for the Prussian Gunners, in the first
moment of surprise, could only defend themselves with their rammers
and handspikes; but with these they plied the intruders with so much
adroitness and resolution as to hurl their leaders to the ground, and
force the remainder to betake themselves to a hasty flight.</p>

<p>Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> had, in the meantime, on perceiving
<span class="smcap">Colbert</span>'s French Lancers hovering upon, and stretching
out beyond, his extreme Right, ordered General <span class="smcap">Pirch</span> to
detach two more Cavalry Regiments&mdash;the Queen's Dragoons and the
4th Kurmark Landwehr Cavalry&mdash;as a reinforcement to the Cavalry of
<span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Corps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>The nearly simultaneous attack upon Wagnelé by
<span class="smcap">Tippelskirchen</span>'s Brigade, previously mentioned as having taken
post in rear of that Village, was not attended with an equal degree
of success. The 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 25th Regiment advanced
in Column through the centre of Wagnelé; but on debouching, the 2nd
Battalion, which led the advance, was suddenly assailed by a fire from
the French Skirmishers who lay concealed in the high corn. Although
its order was thus considerably disturbed; it succeeded, nevertheless,
in effecting its deployment. The 1st Battalion also deployed, but,
in doing so, its Left Wing covered the right of the 2nd Battalion;
and while executing a second movement, intended to clear the front
of the latter, the French Battalions pressing forward, drove in the
Prussian Skirmishers upon the Regiment, which consisted mostly of young
soldiers; when, notwithstanding the conspicuously meritorious exertions
of all their Officers, they were overthrown and dispersed in such a
manner that it became impracticable to lead them back into action in
any other way than by separate Detachments. The 3rd Battalion of this
Regiment shared nearly the same fate; for, having plunged into the high
corn, it received a volley which disordered its ranks, and killed its
three senior Officers; and although it maintained for some time a fire
in return, it was eventually compelled to retire, as were also the 1st
and 2nd Battalions of the 5th Westphalian Landwehr, under precisely
similar circumstances. The Brigade was reformed, under the protection
of the 2nd Prussian Regiment, which now advanced from the Reserve,
boldly encountered the Enemy, and aided by the efficacious fire of the
Foot Battery No. 10, stemmed the further progress of the French, and
thus gained time for the remaining Battalions to reform in rear of
Wagnelé. Upon the advance, however, of a French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span> Column towards its
Left Flank, it fell back as far as the entrance into the Village.</p>

<p>The French now renewed their attacks upon St Amand la Haye, and
made their appearance simultaneously in front and in both flanks of
that Village. The fight again became desperate. <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s
Brigade had, however, exhausted both its ammunition and its strength,
when <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> pushed forward the 3rd Battalion of the 23rd
Regiment (from the Eighth Brigade&mdash;Colonel <span class="smcap">Langen</span>'s), and
soon afterwards the 3rd Battalion of the 9th Regiment, together with
the whole of the 26th Regiment (from the Sixth Brigade&mdash;General
<span class="smcap">Krafft</span>'s); whereupon General <span class="smcap">Pirch</span> withdrew his
Battalions, which had suffered so severely, to the rear of Bry. The
Foot Battery No. 3, belonging to <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s Brigade, had at an
earlier period moved to its left, and had taken up a position near the
quarries on the right of Ligny, by the side of the Foot Battery No. 8,
of <span class="smcap">Jagow</span>'s Brigade.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While the struggle in the Villages in front of the Right of the
Prussian position continue to wear an indecisive and unsettled aspect;
let us return for a moment to Ligny, which we left in possession of
Count <span class="smcap">Henkel</span>'s Fourth Prussian Brigade, supported by the Third
Brigade under General <span class="smcap">Jagow</span>.</p>

<p>The 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 7th Regiment (of <span class="smcap">Jagow</span>'s
Brigade) were ordered to traverse the Village, and to advance in
column against the Enemy. Just as they debouched, they found in their
immediate front, several French Battalions, in Close Column, moving
directly against the village. Both parties at once came to a halt;
the Prussians without being able to deploy in the defile, and the
French without attempting to do so, probably unwilling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span> to lose the
time which such a movement would require. A fire of musketry commenced
which lasted half an hour, and caused much loss. Other Battalions now
hastened across the village, but all at once, a rumour flew rapidly
among them, that the French were in possession of the Churchyard, and
in a moment several muskets were aimed in that direction, and either
thoughtlessly or nervously discharged. Those Battalions that were in
front, at the outlet of the village, became alarmed by this unexpected
firing in their rear. At the same time, a discharge of grape, from
some guns suddenly brought forward by the French, in their immediate
front, augmented their confusion, and forced them to a retreat. They
were closely pursued by the Enemy, whose Skirmishers made a dash at the
Colour of the 2nd Battalion of the 7th Regiment, which they would have
captured but for the noble and determined gallantry with which it was
defended.</p>

<p>General <span class="smcap">Krafft</span>, from whose Brigade (the Sixth) five Battalions
had already been detached, namely, four for the defence of St Amand la
Haye, and one in aid of that of Ligny, now received <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s
Order with his remaining four Battalions (the 1st and 2nd of the 9th,
and the 1st and 3rd of the 1st Elbe Landwehr), to drive the Enemy out
of the latter Village. The Foot Battery No. 15, was posted between the
left of Ligny and the Bois du Loup, and the Foot Battery No. 37, was
directed towards St Amand. The other Batteries posted between Ligny and
St Amand received Orders to retire accordingly as they expended their
ammunition, for the purpose of refitting; and they were successively
relieved by the Foot Battery No. 1, the Horse Battery No. 10, and the
twelve pounder Batteries Nos. 4 and 8. The Horse Battery No. 14 was
advanced across the stream between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> Ligny and Sombref, and took post on
the other side of the valley, where it was much exposed to the Enemy's
fire, and lost 19 Gunners and 53 horses.</p>

<p>General <span class="smcap">Krafft</span> moved forward, in the first instance, only
two Battalions, and kept the others in reserve; but all of them soon
became engaged; for the French, though driven back at first, received
considerable reinforcements.</p>

<p>The fight throughout the whole Village of Ligny was now at the hottest:
the place was literally crammed with the combatants, and its streets
and inclosures were choked up with the wounded, the dying, and the
dead: every house that had escaped being set on fire, was the scene of
a desperate struggle: the troops fought no longer in combined order,
but in numerous and irregular groups, separated by houses either in
flames, or held as little forts, sometimes by the one, and sometimes
by the other party; and in various instances, when their ammunition
failed, or when they found themselves suddenly assailed from different
sides, the bayonet, and even the butt, supplied them with the ready
means for prosecuting the dreadful carnage with unmitigated fury. The
entire Village was concealed in smoke; but the incessant rattle of the
musketry, the crashing of burning timbers, the smashing of doors and
gateways, the yells and imprecations of the combatants, which were
heard through that misty veil, gave ample indication to the troops
posted in reserve upon the Heights, of the fierce and savage nature
of the struggle beneath. In the meantime, the relieving Batteries
on the Prussian side, which had arrived quite fresh from the rear,
came into full play, as did also a reinforcement, on the French side,
from the Artillery of the Imperial Guard. The earth now trembled
under the tremendous cannonade; and as the flames, issuing from the
numerous burning houses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> intermingled with dense volumes of smoke,
shot directly upwards through the light grey mass which rendered the
Village indistinguishable, and seemed continually to thicken, the scene
resembled for a time some violent convulsion of nature, rather than a
human conflict&mdash;as if the valley had been rent asunder, and Ligny had
become the focus of a burning crater.</p>

<p>Long did this fierce and deadly strife continue without any material
advance being made on either side. At length the French gained
possession of a large House, as also of the Churchyard, into which
they brought forward two pieces of cannon. General <span class="smcap">Jagow</span>
vainly endeavoured with the 7th Regiment to retake this House. The 1st
Battalion of the 3rd Westphalian Landwehr displayed the most inflexible
perseverance in its endeavours to drive the French out again from the
Churchyard: it made three unsuccessful attempts to cross an intervening
ditch, and subsequently tried to gain a hollow way, which lay in
the flank of that post, but falling upon the French reinforcements
that were advancing towards it, they were compelled to abandon the
enterprise.</p>

<p>Fresh victims were still required to satiate the "King of Terrors,"
who might be said to hold a gala day in this "Valley of Death."
<span class="smcap">Blücher</span> had ordered Colonel <span class="smcap">Langen</span>'s Brigade (the
Eighth) to follow in succession that of General <span class="smcap">Krafft</span>.
The position vacated by the former, in front of Sombref, was taken
up by Colonel <span class="smcap">Stülpnagel</span>'s Brigade (the Twelfth) of
<span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s Corps, and the chain of Skirmishers of the latter
Brigade extended along the rivulet as far as Ligny. As soon as Colonel
<span class="smcap">Langen</span> had reached the immediate vicinity of Ligny, he posted
the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 21st Regiment upon an eminence near
the Village, and the Foot Battery No. 12, covered by two Squadrons of
the 5th Kurmark Landwehr Cavalry, upon the left of the road leading
to Ligny. The 21st Regiment made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span> no less than six different attacks,
partly in conjunction with the other troops that fought in Ligny, and
partly isolated, without succeeding in disturbing the position of the
Enemy in that portion of the village which lies on the right bank
of the Ligny. Colonel <span class="smcap">Langen</span>, observing the increased fury
and obstinacy of the fight in Ligny, detached thither also the 1st
Battalion of the 23rd Regiment, and the 2nd of the 3rd Elbe Landwehr:
he then took up a position, with the remainder of his Brigade, near
the Mill of Bussy, into which he threw the 2nd Battalion of the 23rd
Regiment. The 1st Battalion of this Corps, having formed two Columns,
rushed into the Village, and, after crossing the stream, received a
sharp fire from the windows of the houses on the opposite side. The
Left Column of the Battalion stormed a farm house, of which, after it
had burst in the gates with hatchets, it gained possession, and thus
protected the advance of the Right Column.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At this moment, <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s final and decisive attack commenced
on this point; but previously to entering upon an account of it, it
will be necessary to resume the narrative of the contest along the
remainder of the Line of Battle.</p>

<p>On the Right, <span class="smcap">Tippelskirchen</span>'s Brigade (the Fifth) was ordered
to renew the attack upon St Amand la Haye; and, as an auxiliary
movement, a bold push was to be made upon the group of houses in rear
of that village, and of Wagnelé, called the Hameau de St Amand. Both
of the 3rd Battalions of the 2nd and 25th Regiments, under Major
<span class="smcap">Witzleben</span>, advanced against the latter point, while the 1st
and 2nd Battalions of the 2nd Regiment, the 3rd Battalion of the 5th
Westphalian Landwehr, and a Battalion of the 25th Regiment made a
direct attack upon St Amand la Haye. Both movements were supported by
the Foot Batteries Nos. 10 and 37, and Colonel <span class="smcap">Thümen</span> was
detached, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span> Silesian Uhlans, and the 11th Hussars, to cover
the Right of the Brigade: the 1st and 2nd Squadrons of the 5th Kurmark
Landwehr Cavalry were posted in reserve. The 3rd Battalion of the 2nd
Regiment opened the attack upon the Hameau de St Amand, and being well
protected on their right by the 11th Hussars, carried it by storm.
The French appeared determined to regain this point, which from its
position, was, in fact, the key to the defence of the three Villages
of St Amand, St Amand la Haye, and Wagnelé; and the struggle for its
possession was most obstinate and sanguinary. All the Battalions of
<span class="smcap">Tippelskirchen</span>'s Brigade became successively engaged. Four
times was St Amand la Haye lost and retaken by the 2nd Regiment, which
suffered severely. General <span class="smcap">Jürgass</span> ordered forward the Horse
Battery No. 6, on the right of which the Foot Battery No. 10 then took
post. The Silesian Uhlans and the 11th Hussars suffered considerably
from their exposure to the Enemy's Artillery. Colonel <span class="smcap">Thümen</span>
was killed at their head, by a cannon shot, and was succeeded by
Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Schmiedeberg</span>, who ordered both these
Regiments to make a change of front to the right; when the Prussian
Lancers dashed forward to meet the advance of a French Regiment, which
they completely defeated, and having followed up the attack with a
vigorous pursuit, fell all at once among the Enemy's Reserves; but they
immediately recovered themselves, and rallied with great celerity,
order, and precision.</p>

<p>About this time, the Light Cavalry Brigade of Colonel <span class="smcap">Marwitz</span>,
already mentioned as having been ordered from the Left, reached the
Right Flank, and was formed up in two lines: also the four Battalions
that had been detached from General <span class="smcap">Krafft</span>'s Brigade,
arrived upon the right of St Amand la Haye, and came into action.
The Battle on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span> both sides on this part of the Field continued to
rage with unabated violence, and with such indefatigable ardour did
the Prussians continue the struggle, that when the fire of their
Infantry Skirmishers was observed to slacken, from the men having
expended their ammunition, the soldiers of the 11th Hussars rushed
into the midst of them, and supplied them with such cartridges as
they had of their own; an act of devotion to which many of them fell
a sacrifice. General <span class="smcap">Jürgass</span> ordered forward the Brigade
(Seventh) of General <span class="smcap">Brause</span> in support of that of General
<span class="smcap">Tippelskirchen</span>, which had suffered a very severe loss. When
General <span class="smcap">Brause</span> had, at an earlier period, taken post at the
Trois Burettes, upon <span class="smcap">Tippelskirchen</span> advancing from that
point to Wagnelé (as previously explained), he stationed both the 3rd
Battalions of the 14th and 22nd Regiments upon an eminence on the left
of the high road, for the purpose of keeping up the communication with
<span class="smcap">Tippelskirchen</span>; and he pushed on the other two Battalions of
the 14th Regiment towards Bry, that they might be nearer at hand, if
required, for the contest in the Villages of Wagnelé and St Amand la
Haye, while the two Squadrons of the Elbe Landwehr Cavalry, attached
to his Brigade, kept a look out upon both sides of the road. These
two Battalions, thus posted, caught the eye of <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> as
he looked round for the nearest available force, and he immediately
ordered them to advance, and join in the contest; and General
<span class="smcap">Brause</span>, on being made acquainted with this disposition, led
forward the 3rd Battalions of the 14th and 22nd Regiments, and the 1st
Battalion of the 2nd Elbe Landwehr, while the four remaining Battalions
of his Brigade, making a change of front to their left, formed up, in
reserve, in rear of the Namur road. On approaching the more immediate
scene of the action, General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> <span class="smcap">Brause</span> came upon the 3rd
Battalion of the 9th Regiment, which had expended all its ammunition:
he procured for it a fresh supply, and ordered it to return into the
Village, along with the 2nd Battalion of the 14th Regiment; while the
1st Battalion of this Regiment threw itself into St Amand la Haye, and
relieved the 2nd Regiment, which now retired, as did also the remainder
of <span class="smcap">Tippelskirchen</span>'s Brigade to the rear of Wagnelé, where it
reformed.</p>

<p>Here, in these Villages on the Right, as well as at Ligny, the fight
never slackened for a moment: fresh masses, from both sides, poured in
among the burning houses as often as the fearfully diminished numbers
and dreadfully exhausted state of the combatants rendered relief
imperatively necessary; partial successes on different points were
constantly met by corresponding reverses on others; and so equally were
the courage, the energies, and the devotion of both parties balanced,
that the struggle between them appeared, from its unabated vigour,
likely to continue until the utter exhaustion of the one should yield
the triumph to the greater command of Reserves possessed by the other.</p>

<p>The anxiety at that time on the part of <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> for the
arrival of either a portion of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s forces, or
<span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Corps, was extreme; and frequently, as he cheered
forward his men in their advance to take part in the contest, did he
address them with the exhortation, "Forward, lads! we must do something
before the English join us!" In fact, his only Reserve remaining was
the Ninth Brigade (General <span class="smcap">Borcke</span>'s), the withdrawal of
which would greatly expose his Centre; and <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, who had
already entertained a suspicion that such was the case, resolved upon
terminating the sanguinary combat in the valley, by boldly advancing
a portion of his own intact Reserves, consisting of the Guard and
<span class="smcap">Lobau</span>'s Corps (which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span> just arrived and was posted on the
right of Fleuras) against the Prussian Centre.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For the execution of his project the French Emperor destined the
Imperial Guard, with <span class="smcap">Milhaud</span>'s Corps of <i>Cuirassiers</i> in
support. He wished to conceal this movement as much as possible from
the Enemy, and caused it to be made to the right, along the rear of the
Corps of <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>, a portion of whose Batteries were ordered to
be withdrawn, for the purpose of affording greater protection to the
Guard, by diverting the Enemy's fire to other points, and of deceiving
him as to the real object of the movement, if observed previously to
the actual execution of the Emperor's design.</p>

<p>This far-famed band of veteran warriors, and <span class="smcap">Milhaud</span>'s
splendid Corps of mailed <i>Cuirassiers</i>, were in full march towards the
lower extremity of Ligny, where they were to cross the stream, when,
all at once, they were halted by an Order direct from the Emperor, who
had decided upon suspending the movement, until he should ascertain
the result of an incident that had occurred upon his extreme Left, and
which had placed him for the time in considerable doubt and anxiety
respecting its real nature.</p>

<p>He had received a message from <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>, informing him that
a strong Column, composed of Infantry, Cavalry, and Artillery, was
advancing towards Fleuras; that it had at first been looked upon as
the Corps detached from <span class="smcap">Ney</span>'s forces, until it was discovered
that it moved by a different road from that along which those troops
had been expected, and in a direction towards the French Left Rear,
instead of the Prussian extreme Right; that <span class="smcap">Girard</span>'s Division
had been consequently induced to fall back, and take up a position to
cover Fleurus; and that the effect produced upon his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span> Corps by the
sudden appearance of this Column was such, that if his Majesty did not
immediately move his Reserve to arrest its progress, his troops would
be compelled to evacuate St Amand and commence a retreat.</p>

<p>This intelligence could not fail to create alarm in the mind of
the French Emperor, who concluded that the Corps in question
had been detached against his Rear, as a diversion in favour of
<span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, from the Army of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, who had
probably obtained some signal triumph over <span class="smcap">Ney</span>. Another
Officer arrived from <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>, reiterating the account
previously given. <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> instantly gave the Order for the
halt of the Imperial Guard; and despatched one of his Aides de Camp to
reconnoitre the strength and disposition of the Column, and to discover
the object of its movement.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The commencement of the march of the Imperial Guard and
<span class="smcap">Milhaud</span>'s <i>Cuirassier</i> Corps towards Ligny, had been conducted
with so much skill, and the man&oelig;uvring of these troops at one point
in their line of march to shelter themselves from the fire of the
Prussian Batteries, to which they had become suddenly exposed, bore so
much the appearance of a retrograde movement, accompanied as it was by
the withdrawal of a portion of the guns of <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>'s Corps,
that the Prussians were completely deceived by it. Intelligence was
hastily conveyed to <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> that the Enemy was retreating;
whereupon he ordered the march of all the remaining disposable
Battalions of Colonel <span class="smcap">Langen</span>'s Brigade (the Eighth) upon St
Amand, to enable him to take advantage of the circumstance by pressing
upon the Enemy's Left.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Colonel <span class="smcap">Marwitz</span> had been menaced by the
advance of a considerable line of Cavalry and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> Battery, which latter
annoyed him but little. This Cavalry did not, however, seem much
disposed to risk a close encounter: once it put forward a Detachment,
which was overthrown by two Squadrons of the 7th and 8th Uhlans,
and then a Regiment of French <i>Chasseurs à Cheval</i> fell upon the
Skirmishers of the 2nd Regiment of Infantry, but was driven back by two
Squadrons of the 5th Kurmark Landwehr Cavalry. Colonel <span class="smcap">Marwitz</span>
had been ordered by General <span class="smcap">Jürgass</span> to send out Patrols in
different directions from the Right Flank, for the purpose of seeking
out the communication with the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s forces.
These brought in prisoners, from whom it was ascertained that a whole
French Corps, the First, under Count <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>, was in that
vicinity.</p>

<p>Subsequently, French Cavalry were perceived between Mellet and Villers
Perruin; whereupon Colonel <span class="smcap">Marwitz</span>, who had been reinforced
by two Squadrons of the Pomeranian Hussars, ordered a change of front
of his Brigade in this direction, then deployed his eight Squadrons in
two lines, with considerable intervals, and withdrew them, alternately,
towards the high road; followed, though not vigorously, by three French
Regiments of Cavalry and a Battery, comprising <span class="smcap">Jaquinot</span>'s
Light Cavalry Brigade, attached to d'Erlon's Corps. As he approached
the <i>chaussée</i>, the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 2nd Elbe Landwehr, as
also the 3rd Battalion of the 22nd Regiment, advanced to his support.</p>

<p>Until about six o'clock the action along that part of the line
which extended from Sombref to Balatre, had not been carried on
with any degree of energy, and the occupation of the opposing
forces was generally limited to mutual observation. Now, however,
the French Infantry (of which only a small portion was attached to
<span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s Cavalry), penetrated as far as the precincts of the
Village of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> Tongrines; but Colonel <span class="smcap">Kämpfen</span>'s Brigade (the
Tenth), having been successively reinforced by all the Battalions of
Colonel <span class="smcap">Luck</span>'s Brigade (the Eleventh) excepting one which was
left in reserve, the French were easily repulsed, and the Prussians
maintained full possession of all this portion of their original
position.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was about seven o'clock when the Aide de Camp returned from his
reconnaissance, and reported to <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> that the Column
in the distance which had caused so much uneasiness proved to be
<span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s Corps; that <span class="smcap">Girard</span>'s Division, upon being
undeceived, had resumed its position in the Line of Battle; and that
<span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>'s Corps had maintained its ground.</p>

<p>This movement of <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s Corps admits of being
satisfactorily explained. <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, having received
information that <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span> had been left in reserve in front
of Gosselies, and inferring, perhaps, from this circumstance that
<span class="smcap">Ney</span> was sufficiently strong to be able to hold his ground at
Quatre Bras, without further aid than what he had at hand, resolved
upon employing this Corps upon the Prussian Right Flank; but in the
meantime, <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span> had, in pursuance of instructions from
<span class="smcap">Ney</span>, continued his march towards Quatre Bras; and having
himself proceeded in advance, had reached Frasne, at which place
Colonel <span class="smcap">Laurent</span> found him, and communicated to him the
Emperor's Order for the march of his Corps upon St Amand; adding that
on coming up with the head of his Column, he had taken upon himself to
change its direction of march into that of St Amand. <span class="smcap">D'Erlon</span>
hastened to comply with <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s wishes, and despatched
General <span class="smcap">d'Elcambre</span>, his Chief of the Staff, to make known the
movement to Marshal <span class="smcap">Ney</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>His route from Frasne towards St Amand, the point prescribed by the
Order, lay through Villers Perruin, and the movement was altogether
one of a retrograde nature. Hence the direction of the Column, as
seen in the distance, was well calculated to alarm the troops of
the French extreme Left; as also to excite surprise in the mind of
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, who having formed no expectation of the arrival of
any French troops in the Field by any other direction than that from
Gosselies upon St Amand, or perhaps from Quatre Bras upon Bry, also
participated in the opinion that the Column in question, under its
attendant circumstances and general disposition, could be no other than
that of an Enemy. As <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span> debouched from Villers Perruin,
and advanced upon the prescribed point, St Amand, he threw out his
Cavalry (<span class="smcap">Jaquinot</span>'s) to his Left, for the protection of this
Flank; and it was before this Cavalry that the Prussian Brigade, under
Colonel <span class="smcap">Marwitz</span>, retired in the manner already explained, a
movement which fully restored confidence to <span class="smcap">Girard</span>'s Division.</p>

<p>All at once this Column was observed to halt, to indicate an
indecision in its intentions, and finally to withdraw from the
Field. <span class="smcap">D'Erlon</span> had in fact just received from <span class="smcap">Ney</span>
a peremptory Order to join him without delay, with which he resolved
to comply, probably concluding that he was bound to do so from the
circumstance of his having been in the first instance placed under
the Marshal's immediate command; having ascertained also from the
Emperor's Aide de Camp that he was not the bearer of any instructions
whatever from <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> as to his future movements, and that
the appearance of his Corps upon that part of the Field of Battle
had been quite unexpected. This pressing Order had been despatched
by <span class="smcap">Ney</span> immediately previous to the arrival of Colonel
<span class="smcap">Laurent</span> on the Heights of Gemioncourt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>If the first appearance of this Column had caused alarm and perplexity
among the troops of the French Left Wing, the apprehensions it excited
on the Prussian Right, when its Cavalry was observed to advance and
to drive back Colonel <span class="smcap">Marwitz</span>' Brigade, which had been sent
towards it <i>en reconnaissance</i> (as already explained), were still
greater; and its equally unexpected disappearance (with the exception
of its Cavalry, and a portion of its Infantry), at a moment when it was
felt that its vigorous co-operation must have rendered the issue of the
Battle no longer doubtful, was looked upon as a particularly fortunate
turn of affairs; and <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s hopes revived as he prepared to
carry into effect his meditated attack upon the French Left Flank.</p>

<p>There did not appear on the part of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> any eagerness to
resume the movement of the Imperial Guard towards the lower extremity
of Ligny, but rather an anxiety to await calmly the most favourable
moment for his projected attack. Doubtless he had discovered the march
of the remaining Battalions of Colonel <span class="smcap">Langen</span>'s Brigade, from
Sombref towards St Amand, as a further reinforcement to the Prussian
Right, and calculated upon paralysing the attack which <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>
was evidently preparing against his Left Flank, by executing a sudden
and vigorous assault on the Prussian Centre, with a preponderating mass
of fresh troops.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At length, towards eight o'clock, the Emperor gave the Order for
the Guard and <span class="smcap">Milhaud</span>'s Corps of <i>Cuirassiers</i> to resume
their march. The same precautions were observed as before for
masking the movement as much as possible, and so successfully, that
<span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>, on observing a French Battery opposite Tongrines
entirely withdrawn, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span> <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s lines of Cavalry presenting
a diminished extent of front, and conceiving, at the same time, that
the contest in Ligny was assuming a change favourable to the Prussians,
concluded that the moment had then arrived in which an attack might
be made with every probability of success, upon the Right Flank of
the Enemy. He had only one Brigade remaining of the Cavalry of his
Corps, namely that of Colonel Count <span class="smcap">Lottum</span>; the other Brigade,
under Colonel <span class="smcap">Marwitz</span>, having been, as already explained, for
some time detached to the extreme Right of the Prussian Army. General
<span class="smcap">Hobe</span>, who commanded this Cavalry Division, had previously
moved forward Count <span class="smcap">Lottum</span>'s Brigade and posted it in rear of
Colonel <span class="smcap">Kämpfen</span>'s Infantry Brigade. <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span> now
desired him to advance with <span class="smcap">Lottum</span>'s Brigade and the Horse
Battery No. 19, along the Fleurus high road.</p>

<p>In carrying this Order into effect, General <span class="smcap">Hobe</span> posted the
Battery, in the first instance, close to the twelve pounder Battery
No. 7, which stood across the Fleurus high road, about midway between
the junction of the latter with the Namur road and the Bridge over the
Ligny. A cannonade was opened from this point upon the French guns on
the opposite Height, to which the latter replied with great spirit, and
one of the guns of the Battery was dismounted. The remaining guns were
now advanced rapidly along the high road, preceded by two Squadrons of
the 7th Dragoons: on getting into position, two of the guns continued
upon the road itself, on which the French had also posted two pieces,
but scarcely had the Squadrons formed up, and the Battery fired a few
rounds, when they were furiously attacked by the 5th and 13th French
Dragoons of <span class="smcap">Excelmans</span>' Cavalry Corps: in an instant they were
thrown into confusion; the two guns upon the road escaped, while the
remainder fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span> into the hands of the French Dragoons, who closely
pursued the Prussians.</p>

<p>General <span class="smcap">Borcke</span> (commanding the Ninth Brigade) observing this
<i>mêlée</i> upon the Fleurus road, immediately pushed forward the 1st and
3rd Battalions of the 1st Kurmark Landwehr, and posted them in rear
of the hedges and walls running parallel with the high road, so as
to flank the Enemy's Cavalry; the 2nd Battalion of the same Regiment
followed the movement, and was finally stationed upon the road. In
order to support these Battalions, and to preserve the communication
with Colonel <span class="smcap">Stülpnagel</span>'s Brigade (the Twelfth) on his right,
he occupied Mont Potriaux and its outlets with the remainder of his
Brigade, excepting the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 8th Regiment,
which he held in reserve.</p>

<p>The 5th and 13th French Dragoons finding themselves likely to be
thus seriously impeded both in front and on their left, and finally
experiencing on their right a cannonade from the two Batteries attached
to Colonel <span class="smcap">Kämpfen</span>'s Brigade, which had moved forward from
the Height above Tongrines to the rise of ground south of Tongrenelle,
retired from this part of the Field.</p>

<p>It will be recollected that Colonel <span class="smcap">Stülpnagel</span>'s Brigade, on
relieving that of Colonel <span class="smcap">Langen</span> in front of Sombref, had
extended a chain of Skirmishers along the stream as far as Ligny: these
were now reinforced by both the 3rd Battalions of the 31st Regiment and
the 6th Kurmark Landwehr, with the 3rd Battalion of the 5th Kurmark
Landwehr in reserve. The 1st and 2nd Battalions of the Kurmark Landwehr
were posted on the Height between Sombref and Bois du Loup, having on
their right and somewhat in advance, two Squadrons from each of the
5th and 6th Regiments of Kurmark Landwehr Cavalry, together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span> with two
guns from the Foot Battery No. 12. The remaining four Battalions of
the Brigade were in reserve immediately in front of the inclosures of
Sombref.</p>

<p>It was nearly eight o'clock, when General <span class="smcap">Krafft</span> despatched
an Aide de Camp to the rear with a message stating, that it was only
by dint of extraordinary efforts that the troops in Ligny could hold
out against the Enemy, who was continually advancing with fresh
reinforcements. General Count <span class="smcap">Gneisenau</span> (the Chief of Staff of
the Prussian Army), in the absence of the Prince, sent word that the
Village must be maintained, at whatever sacrifice, half an hour longer.</p>

<p>About the same time, General <span class="smcap">Pirch II.</span> sent word to
<span class="smcap">Blücher</span> that his Brigade, in defending St Amand la Haye, had
expended the whole of its ammunition, and that even the pouches of the
killed had been completely emptied. To this the Prince replied, that
the Second Brigade must, nevertheless, not only maintain its Post, but
also attack the Enemy with the bayonet.</p>

<p>In fact, the exhaustion of the Prussian troops was becoming more
manifest every moment. Several Officers and men, overcome by long
continued exertion, were seen to fall solely from excessive fatigue.
No kind of warfare can be conceived more harassing to the combatants
than was the protracted contest in the Villages which skirted the
front of the Prussian position. It partook also of a savage and
relentless character. The animosity and exasperation of both parties
were uncontrollable. Innumerable individual combats took place. Every
house, every court, every wall, was the scene of a desperate conflict.
Streets were alternately won and lost. An ungovernable fury seized
upon the combatants on both sides, as they rushed wildly forward to
relieve their comrades exhausted by their exertions in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> deadly
strife&mdash;a strife in which every individual appeared eager to seek out
an opponent, from whose death he might derive some alleviation to the
thirst of hatred and revenge by which he was so powerfully excited.
Hence no quarter was asked or granted by either party.</p>

<p class="caption">
Battle of Ligny
at &frac12; past 8 o'clock p.m.
</p>

<p>When it is considered that a very great portion of the Prussian Army
consisted of young soldiers, who were under fire for the first time,
their bravery and exertions in maintaining so lengthened a contest of
this nature, with the veteran warriors of the French Army, cannot fail
to be regarded with the highest admiration.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such were the distribution and the state of the Prussian troops
throughout their Line, when <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> arrived near the lower
extremity of Ligny, with a formidable Reserve. This consisted of eight
Battalions of the Guard, of <span class="smcap">Milhaud</span>'s Corps of Heavy Cavalry,
comprising eight Regiments of <i>Cuirassiers</i>, and of the <i>Grenadiers à
Cheval</i> of the Guard. It was not, however, his sole Reserve; for most
opportunely <span class="smcap">Lobau</span>'s Corps had just arrived and taken post on
the right of Fleurus. The troops which the French Emperor held thus in
hand ready to launch as a thunderbolt against the weakened Centre of
the Prussian Line of Battle, were perfectly fresh, not having hitherto
taken any part whatever in the contest, and they might justly be styled
the flower of his Army. It was this consciousness of the vantage
ground he then possessed which, upon his perceiving the comparatively
unoccupied space in rear of Ligny, called forth from him the remark to
Count <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>, "They are lost: they have no Reserve remaining!"
He saw that not another moment was to be delayed in securing the
victory which was now within his grasp, and gave his last Orders for
the attack at the very time when <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, whose Right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span> had
just been strengthened by the arrival of the remaining three Battalions
of Colonel <span class="smcap">Langen</span>'s (the Eighth) Infantry Brigade, was making
his dispositions for vigorously assailing the French Army in its Left
Flank.</p>

<p>The projected movement that was to decide the Battle was preceded,
at about half past eight o'clock, by the rapid advance of several
Batteries of the Guard, which opened a most destructive fire upon the
Prussians posted within, and formed in the immediate rear of, Ligny.
Under cover of this cannonade, <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>, with <span class="smcap">Pecheux</span>'s
Infantry Division, reinforced the troops that still maintained that
half of the Village which lay on the right bank of the rivulet, and
pushed forward with a determination to dislodge the Enemy from the
remaining portion on the left bank. While the Prussian Infantry in rear
of Ligny were in movement for the purpose of relieving their comrades
who were already giving way before this renewed attack, they suddenly
perceived, on the French right of the Village, a Column issuing from
under the heavy smoke that rolled away from the well served Batteries
which had so unexpectedly opened upon them, and, which continued so
fearfully to thin their ranks; and, as the mass rapidly advanced down
the slope with the evident design of forcing a passage across the
valley, they could not fail to distinguish both by its well sustained
order and compactness, and by its dark waving surface of bearskins,
that they had now to contend against the redoubted Imperial Guard.
Ligny being thus turned, the Prussian Infantry, instead of continuing
its advance into the Village, was necessitated, by its inferiority of
numbers, to confine its operations to the securing, as far as possible,
an orderly retreat for the defenders of the place.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding their dreadfully exhausted and enfeebled state, and
their knowledge that a body of fresh troops was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> advancing against
them, a body, too, which they knew was almost invariably employed
whenever some great and decisive blow was to be struck, they evinced
not the slightest symptom of irresolution, but, on the contrary,
were animated by the most inflexible courage. The sun had gone down,
shrouded in heavy clouds, and rain having set in, the battlefield would
speedily be enveloped in darkness; hence the Prussians felt that it
required but a little more perseverance in their exertions to enable
them to counterbalance their deficiency of numbers upon any point of
their Line by a stern and resolute resistance, sufficient to secure for
the entire of their Army the means of effecting a retreat, unattended
by those disastrous consequences which a signal defeat in the light of
day might have entailed upon them.</p>

<p>The 21st Regiment of Infantry boldly advanced against the French
Column, with a determination to check its further progress; but soon
found itself charged in flank by Cavalry that had darted forward
from the head of a Column which, by the glimmering of its armour,
even amidst the twilight, proclaimed itself a formidable body of
<i>Cuirassiers</i>. It was, in fact, <span class="smcap">Milhaud</span>'s whole Corps of that
description of force, which had effected its passage on the other side
of the village. The 9th Regiment of Infantry fought its way through a
mass of Cavalry, whilst Major <span class="smcap">Wulffen</span>, with two weak Squadrons
of the 1st Westphalian Landwehr Cavalry, made a gallant charge against
the French Infantry, which received it with a volley at a distance
of twenty paces. The Prussian Infantry compelled to evacuate Ligny,
effected its retreat in Squares, in perfect order, though surrounded by
the Enemy, bravely repelling all further attacks, made in the repeated
but vain attempts to scatter it in confusion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, who had arrived upon the spot from his Right,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
having, in consequence of this sudden turn of affairs, been under the
necessity of relinquishing his meditated attack upon the French Left,
now made a last effort to stem the further advance of the Enemy, and,
if possible, to force him back upon Ligny. The rain having ceased, it
became lighter, and the Enemy's Columns being more clearly discernible,
the Prince immediately ordered the advance of three Regiments of
the Cavalry attached to the First <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, namely, the 6th
Uhlans, the 1st West Prussian Dragoons, and the 2nd Kurmark Landwehr
Cavalry. These Regiments, which constituted the only Cavalry force
immediately at hand, had for some time been posted in reserve, and
had suffered severely from their exposure to the fire from the French
Artillery. Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">Röder</span> directed the 6th Uhlans
to make the first charge. The Regiment was led on by Lieutenant
Colonel <span class="smcap">Lützow</span>, to whose Brigade it belonged. In the charge
which was directed upon the Enemy's Infantry, <span class="smcap">Lützow</span> and
several of his Officers fell under a volley of musketry. The Regiment,
which was about 400 strong, lost on this occasion 13 Officers and 70
men. A second attack, made by the 1st West Prussian Dragoons, and
supported by the 2nd Kurmark Landwehr Cavalry, seemed to offer a fair
prospect of penetrating the French Infantry, when the former Regiment
was unexpectedly charged in flank by the Enemy's <i>Cuirassiers</i>, and
completely dispersed. The Westphalian, and 1st Kurmark Landwehr
Cavalry, with several other Squadrons of the Landwehr, were collected
together, and formed a mass of twenty four Squadrons, with which a
further attack was made upon the Enemy, but without success.</p>

<p>The cause of this failure is to be attributed not to the want of
sufficient Cavalry, for indeed there was an ample<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span> number for the
purpose, but to the confusion and disorder consequent upon the surprise
which the Enemy's attack had occasioned, and which was augmented by
the darkness that had set in upon the Field. Nor was the failure
caused by the absence of that most essential requisite in a charge of
Cavalry, good example on the part of the Officers who lead the well set
Squadrons into the midst of an Enemy's ranks.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Blücher</span> himself, seeing that the fate of the day depended
solely on the chance of the Cavalry at hand succeeding, while there
was yet light, in hurling back the French Columns into the valley
which they had so suddenly and so resolutely crossed, rallied his
routed horsemen; and placing himself at their head, charged, in his old
Hussar style, with the full determination of restoring, if possible,
that equal footing with the Enemy which had hitherto been so gallantly
maintained. The French firmly stood their ground, and the charge proved
ineffectual. As <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> and his followers retired to rally,
they were rapidly pursued by the French <i>Cuirassiers</i>. At this moment,
the Prince's fine grey charger&mdash;a present from the Prince Regent of
England&mdash;was mortally wounded by a shot, in its left side, near the
saddle girth. On experiencing a check to his speed, <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>
spurred, when the animal, still obedient to the impulse of its gallant
master, made a few convulsive plunges forward; but on feeling that his
steed was rapidly losing strength, and perceiving at the same time
the near approach of the <i>Cuirassiers</i>, he cried out to his Aide de
Camp:&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Nostitz</span>, now I am lost!" At that moment the horse
fell from exhaustion, rolling upon its right side, and half burying
its rider under its weight. Count <span class="smcap">Nostitz</span> immediately sprang
from his saddle, and holding with his left hand the bridle of his own
horse, which had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span> slightly wounded, he drew his sword, firmly
resolved to shed, if necessary, the last drop of his blood in defending
the precious life of his revered General. Scarcely had he done so, when
he saw the <i>Cuirassiers</i> rushing forward at the charge. To attract
as little as possible their attention, he remained motionless. Most
fortunately, the rapidity with which the <i>Cuirassiers</i> advanced amidst
the twilight, already sensibly obscured by the falling rain, precluded
them from recognising, or even particularly remarking, the group,
although they swept so closely by that one of them rather roughly
brushed against the Aide de Camp's horse. Shortly afterwards, the
Prussian Cavalry having rallied, and reformed, in their turn began to
drive back the French. Again the thunder of their hoofs approached, and
again the flying host whirled past the Marshal and his anxious friend;
whereupon the latter, eagerly watching his opportunity as the pursuers
came on, darted forward, and seizing the bridle of a Noncommissioned
Officer of the 6th Uhlans, named <span class="smcap">Schneider</span>, ordered him and
some Files immediately following, to dismount and assist in saving
the Prince. Five or six powerful men now raised the heavy dead
charger, while others extricated the fallen hero, senseless and almost
immoveable. In this state they placed him on the Noncommissioned
Officer's horse. Just as they moved off, the Enemy was again pressing
forward with renewed speed, and <span class="smcap">Nostitz</span> had barely time to
lead the Marshal, whose senses were gradually returning, to the nearest
Infantry, which gladly received the party, and, retiring in perfect
order, bade defiance to the attacks of its pursuers.</p>

<p>The Horse Battery No. 2, which had supported these Cavalry attacks by
directing its fire against the Left Flank of the Enemy, became, all at
once, surrounded by French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span> Dragoons. These vainly endeavoured to cut
the traces, and the Prussian Artillerymen defended themselves so well
that they succeeded in effecting the escape of the Battery through an
opening in the inclosures of Bry. The Foot Battery No. 3, however, was
overtaken in its retreat by the Enemy's Cavalry, between the Windmill
and Bry, and lost one of its guns.</p>

<p>During these Cavalry attacks, the Prussian Infantry, already exhausted,
and broken up into separate divisions by the desperate contest in the
valley, had collected together at the outlets of the villages. Some
of the Regiments presented a remarkable degree of steadiness and good
order. At length the Cavalry Brigade of General <span class="smcap">Treskow</span>,
then comprising the Queen's and the Brandenburg Dragoons, and the
Brandenburg Uhlans, were brought forward, and made several attacks
upon the French Infantry and <i>Cuirassiers</i>. Colonel <span class="smcap">Langen</span>
advanced, at the same time, from near the Windmill, with the only
Battalion of his Brigade remaining at his disposal, the 2nd of the
23rd Regiment, under the guidance of General <span class="smcap">Pirch I.</span>, and
covered by the Cavalry of General <span class="smcap">Treskow</span>; but all his efforts
proved unavailing. He himself was wounded, and then driven over by
a gun. The Battalion, however, by continuing in admirable order,
enabled General <span class="smcap">Pirch I.</span>, on whom, at this time, the defence
of Ligny had devolved, to effect the retreat of the troops from the
Village. General <span class="smcap">Jagow</span> retired, with a part of his Brigade to
Bry, and immediately occupied this point. Some Battalions of General
<span class="smcap">Krafft</span>'s Brigade (the Sixth) fell back from Ligny, towards the
high road, leaving Bry on their left; others still more to the left
towards Bry.</p>

<p>General <span class="smcap">Pirch II.</span>, whose Brigade (the Second) had been posted
by the Prince in rear of St Amand la Haye, preparatory to a renewed
attack, was upon the point of proceeding to support the Seventh and
Eighth Brigades, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span> seriously engaged, when he observed the retreat
towards Bry. He immediately withdrew his Brigade to this point, where
he supported and facilitated the retreat of the troops from the
Village, with the assistance of the twelve pounder Battery No. 6, and
the Foot Battery No. 34, as also of the Westphalian Landwehr Cavalry,
under Major <span class="smcap">Wulffen</span>, to which latter Corps several Dragoons
that had become separated from their own Regiments, attached themselves.</p>

<p>General <span class="smcap">Grolman</span>, the Quartermaster General of the Prussian
Army, foreseeing the consequences of the Line having been thus broken
by the Enemy, hastened to Bry, and desired General <span class="smcap">Pirch II.</span>
to cover the retreat by means of the troops here collected together.
He then proceeded in the direction of Sombref, and finding near this
place two Battalions of the 9th Regiment (Sixth Brigade) he posted
them in rear of a hollow road, leading from Bry towards Sombref. These
Battalions had, in their retreat from Ligny, defeated several attempts
on the part of the Enemy's Cavalry to break them. <span class="smcap">Grolman</span>, on
perceiving a twelve pounder had stuck fast in this hollow road, ordered
the Battalions to advance again in front of the latter, to assist
in extricating the Battery, and to protect its retreat; which was
immediately accomplished within view of the French Cavalry.</p>

<p>It was at this critical period of the battle, that the 2nd Battalion
of the 1st Westphalian Landwehr, which still continued in reserve,
in rear of Bry, under the command of Captain <span class="smcap">Gillnhaussen</span>,
appeared upon the Height in front, where it particularly distinguished
itself. In the first place it succeeded in effectually checking, by its
vigorous fire, the French <i>Cuirassiers</i>, who were in pursuit of the
Prussian Infantry. Then it drove back French Cavalry which was on the
point of making a fresh attack upon the Prussian Dragoons. Afterwards
it successfully withstood three charges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> by the French Cavalry of the
Guard. General <span class="smcap">Grolman</span> now ordered this Battalion to join the
9th Regiment near Sombref; and, with the latter, to take up a position
at the junction of the cross road from Ligny with that from Bry to
Sombref. This position, which was in rear of the before mentioned
hollow road, was maintained until past midnight.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such were the circumstances resulting from the French having forced
the Prussian Line at Ligny, and pursued in the direction of Bry: it is
now necessary to explain what occurred at that time, at, and in the
vicinity of, Sombref.</p>

<p>The First Brigade, which had been placed in reserve, was ordered to
take post, in Squares, upon the high road to Sombref, to check the
pressure of the Enemy's Cavalry. Subsequently, when the direction of
the retreat was decided upon, it fell back upon Tilly. The Fourth
Brigade, with the exception of one or two Battalions, advanced again
through Sombref towards Ligny, just as the French Cavalry pushed
towards the high road. The Battalions of the Brigade formed Squares,
and fell back upon the high road, whence they continued their further
retreat.</p>

<p>At the time the French troops were debouching from Ligny, Colonel
<span class="smcap">Stülpnagel</span>'s (the Twelfth) Brigade was posted in front of
Sombref; and Colonel <span class="smcap">Rohr</span> had just pushed forward towards
Ligny with the 2nd Battalion of the 6th Kurmark Landwehr, when he
perceived three French Cavalry Regiments advancing against the Right
Wing of the Brigade; whereupon he gradually retired, and the whole
Brigade threw itself into Sombref, just as the French Cavalry made an
attack at the entrance of the Village, and captured the two guns of the
Battery No. 12, which had been posted there. Major <span class="smcap">Dorville</span>
faced about the rear division of the 6th Kurmark Landwehr Cavalry, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
gallantly attacked the French Cavalry, in the hope of checking their
progress; but the lances of his brave followers were shivered against
the cuirasses of their opponents, and for a moment the former could
only defend themselves with their broken poles. The Prussian Infantry,
however, hastened forward in support; the French were driven out of the
Village; and one of the lost guns was retaken.</p>

<p>Every exertion was now made to secure the possession of Sombref.
General <span class="smcap">Borcke</span> (Ninth Brigade) sent thither two Battalions
of the 1st Kurmark Landwehr; which, during this movement, fired upon
the flank of the Enemy's Cavalry as the latter fell back. The defence
of the entrance into the Village from the side of Ligny was confided
to the 2nd Battalion of the 6th Kurmark Landwehr, under Colonel
<span class="smcap">Rohr</span>.</p>

<p>About this time, General <span class="smcap">Jürgass</span> received Orders to cover with
his Cavalry (of the Second Corps) the retreat of the Prussian Infantry
from St Amand la Haye and Wagnelé. General <span class="smcap">Brause</span>, perceiving
that the Enemy had attacked Colonel <span class="smcap">Marwitz</span>' Cavalry Brigade,
on his right, and endangered his communication with the rear, hastened
with the Fusilier Battalions of the 22nd Regiment (which had continued
in reserve in rear of St Amand la Haye) towards the high road, upon
which the greater part of the Seventh Brigade had by this time been
collected. The Prussians, on retiring from St Amand la Haye, were
closely followed by the French. The 1st Battalion of the 14th Regiment
was still in the Hamlet of St Amand when it received the Order to
retire. During its retreat it was attacked whilst in a hollow way. It
immediately showed a front on each flank, and succeeded in driving back
the Enemy. General <span class="smcap">Jürgass</span> now sent forward the 4th Squadron
of the Brandenburg Hussars to attack the Enemy's <i>Tirailleurs</i>, who
were beginning to advance from out of St Amand la<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span> Haye. The latter
were immediately forced back upon the Village. Somewhat later, however,
the French <i>Tirailleurs</i> poured forth in greater numbers from out of
Wagnelé, and threw themselves upon the Right Flank of the retreating
troops. A <i>mêlée</i> ensued, in which General <span class="smcap">Jürgass</span> was shot in
the shoulder.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the Centre of the Prussian Army had been broken by the French
Cavalry, and the Prussian Commander had been placed so completely <i>hors
de combat</i>, Lieutenant General Count <span class="smcap">von Gneisenau</span>, the Chief
of the Staff, having undertaken the direction of affairs, ordered
the retreat of the First and Second Corps upon Tilly; and despatched
Colonel <span class="smcap">Thile</span> with directions to <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>, that
if he could not effect a direct retreat upon Tilly, he was to retire
upon Gembloux, there to unite with <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>, and then effect a
junction with the rest of the Army.</p>

<p>The occupation of Bry by General <span class="smcap">Pirch II.</span> offered a safe
point of retreat to the disordered Prussian Battalions; and, now that
it had become quite dark, <span class="smcap">Pirch</span> led all the troops from this
post towards Marbais, where they reformed, and whence, soon afterwards,
under the command of Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">Röder</span>, they continued
the retreat upon Tilly. <span class="smcap">Marwitz</span>' Cavalry Brigade, which was
not pursued with much vigour by the Enemy, fell back to the rear of the
Battalions formed up to cover its movement, and now joined the rest of
the Cavalry of the Right Wing, in the general retreat.</p>

<p>The Fifth Infantry Brigade was in full retreat upon Marbais when the
1st and 2nd Battalions of the 22nd Regiment still continued posted on
the high road, not far from the Trois Burettes. The good order and
perfect steadiness of these Battalions, which were commanded by Major
<span class="smcap">Sack</span>, completely checked the further advance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span> French
Cavalry, and greatly facilitated the retreat of the Prussian troops.</p>

<p>After General <span class="smcap">Jürgass</span> was wounded, the command of the Rear
Guard devolved upon Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Sohr</span>, of whose Brigade
(the Brandenburg and Pomeranian Hussars) it consisted. He executed this
duty with great success, falling gradually back upon the Cavalry posted
in advance of Tilly by Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>; who then
took command of the whole of the Cavalry employed in protecting the
retreat.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>During the retreat of the Centre of the Prussian Army, which had
been effectually broken, and of its Right from St Amand and Wagnelé,
which, in consequence of <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s previous dispositions
for his contemplated attack upon the French Left, was better
prepared to sustain a reverse of this kind; the Left Wing, under
<span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>, maintained its position, and contributed not a
little, by its firm countenance, in diffusing a considerable degree of
caution into the French movements in advance.</p>

<p>This was strikingly exemplified by the conduct of the 1st and 2nd
Battalions of the 30th Prussian Regiment. They were posted at Mont
Potriaux, and although their knowledge of what was passing on other
points of the Line was very imperfect, still it sufficed to prompt
their Commander to cross the rivulet, and undertake, if not a vigorous
attack, at least a demonstration, which, now that darkness had almost
covered the Field, would tend to impede, perhaps to paralyze, the
French movements against the Prussian Centre. Having effected their
passage, they met at first but a feeble opposition from a line of
Skirmishers: a French Regiment of Dragoons then advanced very close
upon the 2nd Battalion, but was driven off; whereupon both these
Battalions pushed forward, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> gained a Height which was occupied
in force by the Enemy. Here they sustained two more Cavalry attacks,
which proved equally unsuccessful. A mass of Infantry belonging to
<span class="smcap">Lobau</span>'s Corps, having its Flanks covered by parties of
Cavalry, now advanced against the 1st Battalion; but having, in the
dark, exposed a Flank to the Battalion, it was also repulsed.</p>

<p>Major <span class="smcap">Dittfurth</span>, however, finding himself in too isolated a
position, did not deem it prudent to advance further upon ground which
he knew to be in full possession of the Enemy, and therefore retraced
his steps.</p>

<p>A renewed attempt was made, at the same time, by the French Light
Cavalry Brigade under General <span class="smcap">Vallin</span>, to push forward along
the high road towards Sombref, and gain possession of the barrier; but
the attack was as abortive as had been the former one upon this point.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>With the darkness of night, now rapidly deepening, the din of battle,
which had been terrific and incessant until the last faint glimmering
of twilight, became gradually hushed: its expiring sounds still
issuing from the Heights in front of Bry, whence the flashes from the
fire of Artillery, and from that of Skirmishers along the outskirts
of this village (held by General <span class="smcap">Jagow</span> with the 1st and 2nd
Battalions of the 9th Regiment, and the 2nd Battalion of the 1st
Westphalian Landwehr), indicated to the French Army the extreme verge
of its advance; while the still more vivid flashes emitted from the
rattling musketry fire of the two Battalions of the 30th Regiment,
which had so gallantly sallied forth out of Mont Potriaux, under Major
<span class="smcap">Dittfurth</span>, as previously described, as also from the Prussian
guns which defended the approach to Sombref, and frustrated the renewed
attack along the high road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span> towards that point, plainly intimated that
the Prussian Left Wing (<span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s Corps) still firmly
maintained itself in a position whence it might seriously endanger the
Flank of any further movement in advance against the Centre.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>'s Corps (the Third) bivouacked in advance of St
Amand, <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>'s Corps (the Fourth) in front of Ligny, the
Imperial Guard upon the Heights of Bry, <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s Cavalry in
rear of Sombref, and <span class="smcap">Lobau</span>'s Corps (the Sixth) in rear of
Ligny. This possession of the Field of Battle, and the capture of 21
pieces of cannon, were the only advantages of which the French could
boast as the immediate result of so severe a struggle. With these,
however, it would seem that their Emperor was fully satisfied: if he
had entertained any idea of pursuit, it was now abandoned; he took no
measures for watching the movements and prying into the designs of his
adversary: but left his troops resting in their bivouacs, offering no
molestation whatever to the Prussians, whilst he in person returned to
Fleurus, where he passed the night.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The contrast between the circumstances of the two Armies during the
night was very striking; for whilst the victors were indulging in
perfect repose, the vanquished were completely on the alert, seizing
every possible advantage which the extraordinary quietude of their
Enemies afforded during the precious hours of darkness; and never,
perhaps, did a defeated Army extricate itself from its difficulties
with so much adroitness and order, or retire from a hard fought field
with so little diminution of its moral force.</p>

<p>The Prussian Commander was carried to Mélioreux, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span> six miles in
rear of Ligny, and the Head Quarters were established there for the
night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thielemann</span> still retained possession of his original position
in the Line of Battle; and General <span class="smcap">Jagow</span>, with several
detached Battalions belonging to <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Corps, occupied
Bry and its immediate vicinity. From this position the latter General
quietly effected his retreat about an hour after midnight, taking the
direction of Sombref, and thence proceeding to Gembloux, presuming, in
all probability, that the general retreat would be towards the Meuse.
It was not until three o'clock in the morning, when the Field of Battle
had been completely evacuated by the remainder of the Prussian Army,
that <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span> commenced his retreat, which he conducted
slowly, and in perfect order, to Gembloux; near which <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s
<i>Corps d'Armée</i> (the Fourth) had arrived during the night.</p>

<p>The loss of the Prussian Army on the 15th and 16th of June, amounted in
killed and wounded to about 12,000 men: that of the French to between
7,000 and 8,000. But few prisoners were taken on either side.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In consequence of this defeat, <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> was compelled,
in order to maintain and secure his close communication with
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, to abandon the line of the Meuse between Namur
and Liege; but his orderly and unmolested retreat afforded him
sufficient time to remove all his stores and material from these points
to Maestricht and Louvain, which now constituted his new base of
operations.</p>

<p>It was not, however, a defeat which involved the loss of every
advantage previously gained. <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> was not <i>driven</i> from the
Field: but, on the contrary, he maintained it during the night, with
the exception of the Villages of Ligny and St Amand in his front; thus
facilitating the orderly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span> retreat of his own Army, and, at the same
time, affording a considerable degree of security to the direct line of
retreat of the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>.</p>

<p>The defeat certainly compelled the latter to retire on the following
morning, whatever might have been his success at Quatre Bras; but so
long as <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> had it in his power to fall back in such a
manner as to effect his junction the next day with <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>,
the advantage which accrued to the common object of the two Commanders
was of the highest importance. They would then unite after the
concentration of each Army had been accomplished; hitherto, they had
been compelled to meet their opponents before they had succeeded in
collecting their respective forces. If, however, <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>
had been unable to maintain his ground against <span class="smcap">Ney</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> had in this manner succeeded in beating both Armies
in detail; or, if the Prussian defeat had been followed up by a
vigorous pursuit, the loss of the Battle of Ligny might have placed
both Armies in a critical position.</p>

<p>The struggle at Ligny was undoubtedly of a most desperate and
sanguinary character. It was, almost throughout, one continued village
fight; a species of contest which, though extremely harassing and
destructive to both parties engaged, was that most likely to prove of a
long duration, and consequently to afford a better prospect of relief
by the promised support from <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, or by the hoped-for
junction of <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It remains a question whether <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, had he confined
himself during the latter part of the action to the same defensive
system he had so successfully carried on up to that time, instead
of detaching his Reserves to the Right, and preparing for an attack
upon the Enemy's Left, might not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span> have fully maintained his original
position until dark, and thus have saved his Army from defeat. By the
arrival of <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Corps during the night, he would then
have been prepared to meet his opponent on the following morning
with a greatly preponderating force; whilst, on the other hand,
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, having concentrated a considerable portion of
his Army, would have been placed in an equally advantageous position
as regards the already vanquished Enemy in his own front. When it is
considered that along the whole extent of <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s line, the
French had not gained any material advantage upon one single point, and
that the Prussians continued to hold their ground with most exemplary
firmness; the circumstance of his not having delayed the collecting
of his Reserves, for a grand attack upon the Enemy's Left, until
actually joined by either the British or <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s troops, can
scarcely be explained except by a reference to the peculiar character
of the Prussian Chief, whose natural fiery temperament led him, in
all probability to seize with avidity the first prospect which opened
itself of a favourable opportunity of aiming a deadly thrust at his
hated foe, rather than to adhere to that comparatively passive kind
of warfare which so ill suited his own individual inclination and
disposition.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> had undoubtedly gained the victory from the moment
he succeeded in penetrating the Prussian Centre; but it was not
distinguished by that brilliant success, or by those immediate and
decisive advantages, which might have been anticipated from the
admirable manner in which the attack had been prepared, and the care
with which it was concealed from the Prussians, at a moment when they
had no Reserve remaining, and when the co-operation of the British on
their Right, or the arrival of <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Corps from Hannut,
had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span> become quite impracticable. This appears the more surprising
when we reflect that he had a considerable Corps of Cavalry under
<span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> at hand to support this attack, and that the whole
of <span class="smcap">Lobau</span>'s Corps was in the Field, fully prepared for active
operations.</p>

<p>The consequences resulting from the absence of energetic measures on
the part of the French Emperor, in following up the defeat of the
Prussians, on the evening of the 16th and morning of the 17th, will be
fully developed in subsequent Chapters.</p>

<p class="drop">THE bivouac on the Field of Quatre Bras, during the night of the 16th,
continued undisturbed until about an hour before daylight, when a
Cavalry Patrol having accidentally got between the adverse Picquets
near Piermont, caused an alarm in that quarter that was quickly
communicated to both Armies by a rattling fire of musketry, which,
rapidly augmenting, extended itself along the line of the Advanced
Posts. Among the first who hastened to ascertain the origin and nature
of the engagement was <span class="smcap">Picton</span>, who, together with other Staff
Officers, as they arrived in succession, on discovering that no advance
had been attempted or intended on either side, soon succeeded in
restoring confidence. Similar exertions were successfully made on the
part of the French Officers, and as day began to break upon the scene,
both parties resumed their previous tranquillity. In this untoward
affair, the Picquets furnished by <span class="smcap">Kielmansegge</span>'s Hanoverian
Brigade, and by the 3rd Brunswick Light Battalion were sharply engaged,
and a Picquet of the Field Battalion Bremen suffered considerably.</p>

<p>It was not long before <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, who had slept at Genappe,
arrived at Quatre Bras, where he found Major General Sir <span class="smcap">Hussey
Vivian</span>, whose Brigade of Light Cavalry, consisting of the 10th
British Hussars (under Colonel <span class="smcap">Quentin</span>), of the 18th British
Hussars (under Lieutenant Colonel the Hon. <span class="smcap">Henry Murray</span>),
and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span> the 1st Hussars of the King's German Legion (under Lieutenant
Colonel <span class="smcap">von Wissell</span>), was posted on the left of that point
with two strong Picquets thrown out; one, of the 18th Hussars, under
Captain <span class="smcap">Croker</span>, on the Namur road, and the other, of the 10th
Hussars, under Major the Hon. <span class="smcap">Frederick Howard</span>, in front&mdash;with
a Picquet from the latter, under Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Arnold</span>, on the
right of the Namur road.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vivian</span>, on being asked what account he could give of the
Enemy, communicated to the Duke the result of his observations, which
were necessarily very limited, as, with the exception of the firing
that had taken place, as before mentioned, along the line of Picquets,
the French had continued perfectly quiet, and had as yet given no
indication of any offensive movement.</p>

<p>The Duke then took a general survey of the Field, and while sweeping
the horizon with his telescope, he discovered a French Vedette on some
rising ground, in the direction of Fleurus, and a little to the right
of the high road leading to Namur, apparently belonging to some Picquet
thrown out from <span class="smcap">Ney</span>'s extreme Right on the previous night,
after the battle had ceased; or to some detached Corps placed in that
quarter for the purpose of observation, and for the maintenance of the
communication between <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> and <span class="smcap">Ney</span>. The Duke had
received no intelligence of <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>; and, probably, judging
from the advanced position of the Vedette in question that whatever
might have been the result of the Battle of Ligny, the Prussians could
not have made any forward movement likely to endanger <span class="smcap">Ney</span>'s
Right, he came to the conclusion that it was quite possible that,
on the other hand, <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> might have crossed the Namur
road, and cut off his communication with <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, with the
design of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span> man&oelig;uvring upon his Left and Rear, and causing him to be
simultaneously attacked by <span class="smcap">Ney</span>. His Grace therefore desired
<span class="smcap">Vivian</span> to send a strong Patrol along the Namur road to gain
intelligence respecting the Prussian Army.</p>

<p>A Troop of the 10th Hussars, under Captain <span class="smcap">Grey</span>, was
accordingly despatched on this duty, accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel
the Hon. Sir <span class="smcap">Alexander Gordon</span>, one of the Duke's Aides de
Camp. As the Patrol advanced along the road, the Vedette before
mentioned began to circle, evidently to give notice of the approach of
an Enemy, and then retired. This induced the Patrol to move forward
with great caution, so as to guard against the possibility of being
cut off. Nevertheless it continued, but with all due precaution,
advancing along the road, until after passing a few scattered cottages,
comprising a hamlet called Petit Marbais, it reached, about a mile and
a half further on, some rising ground, about five miles from Quatre
Bras, and beyond which was another height. A Vedette was observed
posted upon the latter, but who had evidently not yet discovered the
approach of Captain <span class="smcap">Grey</span>'s Troop. Down in the intervening
hollow was an isolated house, at the door of which stood a dismounted
Sentry, and some horses were standing in an adjoining yard.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Grey</span> directed Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Bacon</span> to patrol
towards the house, while he remained with the remainder of the Troop,
concealed from the Enemy's view, a disposition favoured by the nature
of the ground, and the trees in the hedges, on both sides of the road.
When Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Bacon</span>'s party moved forward, it was discovered
by the Vedette, who began circling, and fired his carabine. The French
Picquet posted in the house instantly rushed out; several of the men
had their jackets and accoutrements off; and the Post could easily have
been captured, had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span> special duty on which the British Patrol was
engaged admitted of an attack. The French turned out very quickly and
galloped to the rear along the high road, while <span class="smcap">Bacon</span>'s party
was recalled. A few French Cavalry galloped up to the Vedette on the
Heights, but evinced no disposition to advance.</p>

<p>It had now become sufficiently evident that, commencing from this
point, the French were in possession of the Namur road; but the
principal object which Sir <span class="smcap">Alexander Gordon</span> had in view was
yet to be attained. The Patrol now retired a little until it reached
a cross road, which a peasant pointed out as the Prussian line of
retreat. Pursuing this track, the Patrol, within an hour, reached
Tilly; where General <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>, who had been placed in temporary
command of the Cavalry, was covering the retreat of the Prussian Army.</p>

<p>After remaining here about a quarter of an hour, during which Sir
<span class="smcap">Alexander Gordon</span> obtained from General <span class="smcap">Zieten</span> the
most ample information respecting the movements of the Prussians, the
Patrol commenced its return, at a quick pace, striking into a cross
road, which joined the high road at a point nearer to Quatre Bras
than the one whence it had quitted it. The Patrol reached Quatre Bras
at about half past seven o'clock; and Sir <span class="smcap">Alexander Gordon</span>
immediately reported to the Duke that the Prussians had retreated
towards Wavre, that the French occupied the ground on which the Battle
had been fought; but that they had not crossed the high road, along
which the Patrol had proceeded almost into the immediate vicinity of
their Advanced Posts.</p>

<p>This latter circumstance was very remarkable, and served to satisfy
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span> that, either <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s victory had not
been followed up with a vigour and an effect, by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span> the safety of
his own Army would have been perilled, or, that it had not been of a
character sufficiently decisive to have enabled the French Emperor to
avail himself of such a vantage ground.</p>

<p>Having ascertained that the contingency for which, as has already
been explained, he was fully prepared, had actually taken place; he
instantly decided upon retrograding his troops to a position in front
of the point of junction of the roads leading from Charleroi and
Nivelles upon Brussels, in which he might rely upon the co-operation of
a sufficient portion of <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s forces from Wavre with his
own, by which he would be enabled to confront <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> and his
main Army with ample means, and thus attain that great aim and end of
all strategy, of "operating with the greatest mass in a combined effort
upon a decisive point."</p>

<p>Hence, a change in the direction of the previously ordered movements
became necessary, and the following instructions were issued:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-left: 45%;">"To General Lord <span class="smcap">Hill</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>Shortly after the departure of the before mentioned Patrol of the 10th
Hussars, along the Namur road, the Duke received some despatches from
England, to which he gave his attention; and now that he had satisfied
himself as to the real state of things, and issued his Orders for the
movements of his distant troops, as also for the retreat of those
present in the Field, he laid himself down on the ground near Quatre
Bras, covered his head with one of the newspapers he had been reading,
which had accompanied those despatches, and appeared to fall asleep.</p>

<p>After remaining some time in this state, he again rose, mounted his
horse, and rode a little distance down the Field in front of Quatre
Bras. He then looked about through his telescope, and expressed to
those about him his astonishment at the perfect stillness of the Enemy,
remarking at the same time, "What if they should be also retiring? It
is not at all impossible."</p>

<p>A second Officer, Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Massow</span>, had been despatched from
the Prussian to the Anglo-Allied Head Quarters; and it was about this
time that he reached the Duke, with a verbal communication respecting
the retreat upon Wavre, and the position intended to be assumed in
that quarter. It was of a nature which, taken altogether, was so far
satisfactory, that <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> immediately sent a verbal
message by this Officer to <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, acquainting him with his
intended retrograde movements, and proposing to accept a battle, on
the following day, in the position in front of Waterloo, provided the
Prince would detach two Corps to his assistance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following is the manner in which the retreat of the Anglo-Allied
Infantry, then in full operation, was executed. It was an important
matter to mask the retreat as much as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> possible, so as to gain time
for the free and unimpeded movement of the Army along the high road
leading to the position in front of Waterloo. For this purpose, the
Light Troops continued to maintain the line of Outposts, until their
respective Supports, which had remained stationary sufficiently long to
conceal the retreat of the troops in their rear, began also to retire.</p>

<p>The First and Fifth British Divisions, and the Second Dutch-Belgian
Division, as also the Brunswick Corps, effected their retreat in
excellent order, notwithstanding the delay that was created by the
narrowness of the bridge and street of Genappe. Their retreat was
covered by <span class="smcap">Alten</span>'s Division, to which were added for this
purpose, the 1st Battalion of the 95th British Rifles, the 2nd and 3rd
Brunswick Light Battalions, the Brunswick Advanced Guard Battalion, and
the Light Companies of <span class="smcap">Byng</span>'s Brigade of Guards.</p>

<p>The main body of <span class="smcap">Alten</span>'s Division commenced its retreat about
eleven o'clock. <span class="smcap">Ompteda</span>'s Brigade of the King's German Legion
was withdrawn to Sart à Mavelines, which it immediately occupied, as
also the Wood of Les Censes in its front. <span class="smcap">Halkett</span>'s British
Brigade then retired secretly until it reached some favourable ground,
a little distance in rear of <span class="smcap">Ompteda</span>'s Brigade, upon which it
was immediately drawn up. <span class="smcap">Kielmansegge</span>'s Hanoverian Brigade
was withdrawn still further to the rear, and occupied a third position.
Thus posted, the Division was ordered, in the event of being attacked,
to retire by Brigades alternately.</p>

<p>It was a little before midday when the Light Troops of <span class="smcap">Alten</span>'s
Division began to retire. They occupied the advanced line, commencing
from the southern extremity of the Wood of Bossu on the right,
extending along Gemioncourt and the inclosures of Piermont, and
crossing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span> Namur road on the left: from which line they gradually
and slowly fell back upon <span class="smcap">Ompteda</span>'s Brigade, in a manner
evincing admirable skill, steadiness, and regularity.</p>

<p>In order more effectually to mask the movements on the Allied side of
the Namur road, the whole of the Cavalry was drawn up in two lines
immediately contiguous to, and in rear of, that road; the Heavy Cavalry
forming the Second Line, and Picquets being thrown out from the First
Line, to relieve those of the retiring Infantry.</p>

<p>The main body of <span class="smcap">Alten</span>'s Division now commenced its further
retreat; but not by alternate Brigades, this mode having been directed
only in the event of an attack; the latter retired successively in the
order in which they stood, preserving their relative distances, so that
they might commence the alternate system of retreat, if attacked. To
facilitate the passage of other portions of the Army through the narrow
defile of the bridge and town of Genappe, this Division retired by
Bezy, and crossed the Genappe, lower down the stream, by the bridge of
Wais le Hutte.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the early part of the morning, <span class="smcap">Ney</span> had, like his opponent,
been ignorant of the result of the Battle of Ligny; but he was aware
that the Anglo-Allied Army had been considerably reinforced during the
night, principally by the arrival of its Cavalry.</p>

<p>The Marshal calculated that if <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> had gained a victory,
and crossed the Namur road, the longer <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> remained
in the position of Quatre Bras, the greater the danger he incurred of
having not only his communication with <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> effectually cut
off, but also his main line of retreat upon Brussels intercepted; and
that in such a case it was wiser not to advance against the British
General, as the latter might then retire, and thus elude the effect of
a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span> combined operation between <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s and his own forces.
He also judged that if, on the other hand, the French Emperor had
been defeated, an attack made on his own part, upon the Anglo-Allied
Army, might subject himself to the risk of having to contend against a
combined operation between <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> and <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>;
and thus expose both his own and <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s forces to the
probability of being defeated in detail.</p>

<p>In this uncertainty, <span class="smcap">Ney</span> sent a message by General Count
<span class="smcap">Flahaut</span>, who happened to be still with him, and who was
returning to rejoin the Emperor wherever he might be found, expressive
of his anxiety to learn the result of the action of the preceding day.
In the mean time, he kept his troops in a state of perfect quietude;
his main body was posted in reserve on the Heights of Frasne, between
which and the Outposts there were intermediate Columns of Support; but
no movement whatever was attempted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ney</span> at length received the information he had solicited, in
a despatch from <span class="smcap">Soult</span>, wherein the result of the Battle of
Ligny was briefly described. It also stated that <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>
was proceeding, with the principal portion of his forces, to the Mill
of Bry, close to which the high road leads from Namur to Quatre Bras,
and that therefore it would not be practicable for the Anglo-Allied
Army to act against him (<span class="smcap">Ney</span>); but that, should such a case
happen, the Emperor would march directly upon it by that road, while
<span class="smcap">Ney</span> should attack it in front, and in this manner that Army
would at once be destroyed. The despatch required from <span class="smcap">Ney</span> a
report of the exact position of his forces, and an account of all that
was going on in his front.</p>

<p>Hence it is evident that <span class="smcap">Ney</span>'s opinion, that a victory
at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> Ligny ought to be followed up by a combined attack upon
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, perfectly coincided with <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s
views; but while <span class="smcap">Ney</span> was thus justified in remaining inactive
during the early part of the day, the fact of the Emperor's not moving
directly upon Genappe with the morning's dawn, and his excessive delay
in breaking up his bivouac at Ligny, are inexplicable. A glorious
opportunity had presented itself for the attainment of his original
design of defeating both Armies in detail, but which was completely
lost by a most extraordinary and fatal want of energy and vigour in
seizing upon the advantages which the victory of Ligny had placed
within his reach.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ney</span>, having ascertained that <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s forces were
in motion, had commenced the advance of his own troops, when a second
despatch reached him, dated, "in front of Ligny, at noon," intimating
that the Emperor had just posted a Corps of Infantry and the Imperial
Guard in advance of Marbais, that he wished him to attack the Enemy at
Quatre Bras, and force him from his position; and that his operations
would be seconded by the Corps at Marbais, to which point his Majesty
was proceeding in person.</p>

<p>Upon discovering that the Anglo-Allied Infantry had retired, and that
the troops around, and in rear of, Quatre Bras, consisted of Cavalry
covering the retreat, <span class="smcap">Ney</span> brought forward his own Cavalry in
advance, and appeared to regulate its movements so that its attack
might be directed against the Front of the British simultaneously with
that of the Cavalry which he now perceived advancing along the Namur
road against its Flank.</p>

<p>About this time, the 10th Hussars were moved across the Namur road,
and down the slope in front where they were halted, in <i>echelon</i> of
Squadrons; and while they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span> thus posted, <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> and
his Staff came to the front of the Regiment. From this spot the Duke
was attentively watching, through his telescope, the dispositions and
movements of the French, whom he could discover as soon as they reached
the Quatre Bras side of Little Marbais; when all at once at a distance
of about two miles, masses were seen forming on the side of the Namur
road, conspicuously glittering in the sun's rays; by which the Duke was
at first induced to believe that they were Infantry, whose bayonets
were so brilliantly reflected; but it was soon discovered that they
were <i>Cuirassiers</i>.</p>

<p>After a short time, these were observed to advance, preceded by
Lancers, and it was not long before the Picquet of the 18th British
Hussars, posted on that road, began skirmishing, as did also the
Picquet of the 10th British Hussars, more in the front of the
position, and likewise, still further to the right, in front of
Quatre Bras, a Picquet consisting of a Squadron of the 11th British
Light Dragoons, detached from Major General <span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span>'s
Brigade, which comprised the 11th Light Dragoons (under Lieutenant
Colonel <span class="smcap">Sleigh</span>), the 12th Light Dragoons (under Colonel
the Hon. <span class="smcap">Frederick Ponsonby</span>), and the 16th Light Dragoons
(under Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Hay</span>). The 10th Hussars then fell
back again into their proper place in the line. <span class="smcap">Vivian</span> now
took up a new alignment, throwing back his Left so as to present
a front to the Enemy's advance, and to protect the left of the
position. <span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span>'s Brigade was then in Right Rear of
<span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s and close to Quatre Bras.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Allied Infantry having, some time previously, entirely
crossed the Genappe, with the exception of the Light Companies of the
Second Brigade of Guards on the right, and of the 1st Battalion 95th
British Regiment (Rifles), on the left, which troops had been directed
to remain until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span> last moment, and were now retiring to Genappe
(where they were subsequently drawn up at the entrance of the town),
and the Duke having satisfied himself that a formidable body of the
French Cavalry was endeavouring to fall upon him and to molest his
retreat, it became a question with his Grace, at that moment, how far
it might be advisable to offer any serious resistance to the advance
of the Enemy; but Lieutenant General the Earl of <span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span>,
the Commander of the Anglo-Allied Cavalry, having remarked that,
considering the defiles in the rear, and the distance to which the
great mass of the Infantry had already retired and from which it
could offer no immediate support, he did not think the Cavalry was
favourably situated for making such an attempt, the Duke assented to
the correctness of this view, and requested his Lordship at once to
carry into effect the retreat of the Cavalry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span> immediately made the following dispositions for this
purpose. The First or Household Brigade of Heavy Cavalry commanded
by Major General Lord <span class="smcap">Edward Somerset</span>, and consisting of
the 1st Life Guards (under Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Ferrior</span>), of
the 2nd Life Guards (under Lieutenant Colonel the Hon. <span class="smcap">Edward P.
Lygon</span>), of the Royal Horse Guards, or Blues (under Lieutenant
Colonel Sir <span class="smcap">Robert Chambre Hill</span>), and of the 1st (or King's)
Dragoon Guards (under Colonel <span class="smcap">Fuller</span>), together with the
Second Brigade of Heavy Cavalry, commanded by Major General the
Honourable Sir <span class="smcap">William Ponsonby</span>, consisting of the 1st,
or Royal Dragoons (under Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Clifton</span>), of
the 2nd Royal North British Dragoons, or Scots Greys (under Colonel
<span class="smcap">Hamilton</span>), and of the 6th, or Inniskilling Dragoons (under
Colonel <span class="smcap">Muter</span>), formed the Centre Column, which was to retire
by the Brussels high road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span>'s and <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s Brigades constituted the
Left Column, which was to effect its retreat by a Bridge over the
Genappe at Thuy, still lower down the stream than that by which
<span class="smcap">Alten</span>'s Infantry Division had crossed.</p>

<p>The Right Column was formed of part of the Third Light Cavalry Brigade,
commanded by Major General Sir <span class="smcap">William Dörnberg</span>, the 1st
and 2nd Light Dragoons of the King's German Legion (under Lieutenant
Colonels <span class="smcap">Bülow</span> and <span class="smcap">de Jonquières</span>), while the
remaining Regiment, which was the 23rd British Light Dragoons (under
Colonel the Earl of <span class="smcap">Portarlington</span>), was employed as a portion
of the Rear Guard of the Centre Column. The 15th British Hussars (under
Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Dalrymple</span>), belonging to the Fifth Cavalry
Brigade, under Major General Sir <span class="smcap">Colquhoun Grant</span>, was also
attached to the Right Column; while of the two remaining Regiments
of the Brigade, the 2nd Hussars of the King's German Legion (under
Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Linsingen</span>), and the 7th British Hussars
(under Colonel Sir <span class="smcap">Edward Kerrison</span>), the former had been left
in occupation of a line of Posts on the French frontier, extending from
Courtrai, through Menin, Ypres, Loo, and Fürnes, to the North Sea, and
the latter formed a part of the Rear Guard of the Centre Column. This
Right Column was to pass the Genappe by a ford higher up the stream
than the town of Genappe.</p>

<p>These skilful dispositions had scarcely been arranged, when the
Picquet of the 18th Hussars, on the left, came in at a good round
trot, followed by two or three Squadrons of French Cavalry, upon
which <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s Battery of Horse Artillery, opened a fire
whereby their advance was checked. The Enemy, however, was observed
to be very active in bringing up his Artillery, which soon opened
upon the Hussar Brigade. <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>, having received the Earl
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span> <span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span>'s instructions to retire, accompanied with
an intimation that he would be supported by <span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span>'s
Brigade, then in his rear, and observing that the French Cavalry was
pressing forward in great numbers, not only in his front, but also
on his flank, he put his Brigade about, and retired in line, covered
by the Skirmishers. The French followed, with loud cries of "<i>Vive
l'Empereur!</i>" and just as the Brigade reached a sort of hollow, their
guns again opened, throwing shells, which mostly flew over the heads
of the 18th Hussars, against which Regiment they appeared to be
principally directed. In the mean time, <span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span>'s Brigade
had been drawn up in support, on rather a commanding position, and
<span class="smcap">Vivian</span> approached it in the full expectation that it would
open out for the passing through of his own men, and take the Rear
Guard in its turn; but on the Hussars arriving within fifty or sixty
yards of the Fourth Brigade, <span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span> put it about, and
retired&mdash;<span class="smcap">Vivian</span> not being aware that <span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span> had
previously received Orders to retire and leave the road clear for
the retreat of the Cavalry in his front. <span class="smcap">Vivian</span> immediately
occupied the ground thus vacated, and, with a view to check the Enemy's
advance more effectually, ordered the 18th Hussars to charge, as soon
as the French approached within favourable reach.</p>

<p>The weather, during the morning, had become oppressively hot; it was
now a dead calm; not a leaf was stirring; and the atmosphere was close
to an intolerable degree; while a dark, heavy, dense cloud impended
over the combatants. The 18th Hussars were fully prepared, and awaited
but the command to charge, when the Brigade guns on the right commenced
firing, for the purpose of previously disturbing and breaking the order
of the Enemy's advance. The concussion seemed instantly to rebound
through the still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span> atmosphere, and communicate, as an electric spark,
with the heavily charged mass above. A most awfully loud thunder
clap burst forth, immediately succeeded by a rain which has never,
probably, been exceeded in violence even within the tropics. In a very
few minutes the ground became perfectly saturated; so much so that it
was quite impracticable for any rapid movement of the Cavalry. The
Enemy's Lancers, opposed to the Sixth British Brigade, began to relax
in their advance, and to limit it to skirmishing; but they seemed more
intent upon endeavouring to envelope, and intercept the retreat of,
the Hussars. <span class="smcap">Vivian</span> now replaced the 18th Hussars by the 1st
Hussars of the King's German Legion, as Rear Guard, with Orders to
cover well the Left Flank and Left Front of the Brigade. He had already
sent off his Battery of Horse Artillery, to cross the Genappe by the
Bridge of Thuy, and despatched an Aide de Camp to <span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span>,
to request he would move his Brigade as quickly as possible across that
Bridge, so that he might meet with no interruption in his retreat, in
the event of his being hard pressed.</p>

<p>Of the Centre Column, the Heavy Brigades of Lord <span class="smcap">Edward
Somerset</span> and Sir <span class="smcap">William Ponsonby</span> had retired along the
Charleroi road, and were taking up a position on some high ground, a
little in rear of Genappe, on either side of that road. The detached
Squadron of the 11th Light Dragoons (under Captain <span class="smcap">Schreiber</span>),
was withdrawn and directed to retire through the above town. The 23rd
Light Dragoons were also withdrawn, and posted upon the ascent between
Genappe and the position occupied by the two Heavy Brigades. The 7th
Hussars continued on the south side of Genappe, as Rear Guard.</p>

<p>Neither the Centre, nor the Right, Column experienced any serious
molestation in its retreat while on the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span> side of the Genappe:
large bodies of Cavalry were seen in motion, but their Advanced Guards
limited their attacks to skirmishing.</p>

<p>At length the 7th Hussars retired through Genappe, after having thrown
out their Right Squadron, commanded by Major <span class="smcap">Hodge</span>, as Rear
Guard, to cover the retreat of the Centre Column, regulating its
proceedings in conformity with such Orders as it might receive from
Major General Sir <span class="smcap">William Dörnberg</span>, who had been desired to
superintend the movements of the Skirmishers. Major <span class="smcap">Hodge</span> led
out the Right Troop, under Captain <span class="smcap">Elphinstone</span>, to skirmish,
while Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Standish O'Grady</span>, who commanded the Left
Troop, held the high road, from which he had occasionally to send
assistance to the former, and frequently to advance, to enable the
Skirmishers to hold their ground, as their movements were difficult,
through ploughed fields so soft that the horses always sank up to their
knees, and sometimes to their girths. In this manner, every inch of
ground was disputed, until within a short distance of Genappe.</p>

<p>Here <span class="smcap">Dörnberg</span> informed Lieutenant <span class="smcap">O'Grady</span> that he
must leave him; that it was of the utmost importance to face the
Enemy boldly at this spot, as the Bridge in the town of Genappe was
so narrow that the Squadron would have to pass it in file; that he
was to endeavour as much as possible to obtain time for drawing off
the Skirmishers, but not to compromise his Troop too much. Lieutenant
<span class="smcap">O'Grady</span> then called in his Skirmishers, and advanced with
his own Troop boldly up the road at a trot. The Cavalry immediately
opposed to him, went about, followed by him for some distance; and he
thus continued alternately advancing and retiring, until he saw all the
Right Troop safe on the road in his rear. He then began to retire at a
walk, occasionally halting and fronting, until he turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span> the corner of
the town of Genappe: when he filed the men from the left, and passed
through the place at a gallop. Upon the arrival of the Squadron at the
opposite entrance of Genappe, it was posted between this point and the
main body of the 7th Hussars, which had been drawn up on the road in a
column of divisions, prepared to check the advance of the Enemy on his
debouching from the town.</p>

<p>The British Left Cavalry Column continued its retreat, which was
towards the little Bridge of Thuy, by deep narrow lanes, converted
by the tremendous pour of rain into perfect streams. <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>
withdrew the 10th and 18th Hussars from the position he last occupied,
but on their approaching the Genappe an interruption occurred in
consequence of <span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span>'s Brigade not having effected its
passage across the Bridge; and the delay became so great that he was
induced to put about the 18th Hussars, with a view to their affording a
Support to the 1st German Hussars, should they require it. In a short
time after this, <span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span>'s Brigade resumed its progress: the
10th Hussars followed; and, as the 1st Hussars, with which Regiment
<span class="smcap">Vivian</span> himself was at the moment, continued to maintain a
vigorous and effective skirmish, he ordered the 18th to resume its
retrograde movement; having previously directed that some men of the
10th Hussars should be dismounted on reaching the opposite bank of the
Genappe, and be prepared with their carbines to defend the passage,
should the retreat of the remainder of the Brigade be severely pressed.
After skirmishing some time, <span class="smcap">Vivian</span> despatched a Squadron of
the 1st German Hussars to the Bridge, and the moment he began to do
so, the French Cavalry again pushed forward with so much boldness and
rapidity as to interpose between the Left Squadron and the main body of
the Regiment, and to compel that Squadron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span> to pass the Genappe lower
down than the Bridge over which the Brigade passed the little stream.
Having ascertained that all was ready, <span class="smcap">Vivian</span> galloped down
the road to the Bridge with the remainder of the 1st German Hussars.
The French followed them, loudly cheering, but as soon as the Hussars
cleared the Bridge, and the Enemy's Dragoons reached it, some of the
dismounted men that had been formed along the top of the opposite
bank, in rear of a hedge, overlooking the Bridge and a hollow way,
through which the road led from it up the ascent, opened a fire upon
the foremost of the French Lancers that had come up to the other end
of the Bridge, while the remainder of the 10th, and the whole of the
18th Hussars, were drawn up along the rising ground or bank. The good
countenance here shown by <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s Brigade, combined with the
soft and miry state of the ground after the thunderstorm had set in,
completely checked the pursuit by the Enemy's Cavalry, which now turned
towards the high road.</p>

<p>The Left Cavalry Column, after <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s Brigade had remained
in its position for some little time, continued its retreat without
further molestation (the Enemy having contented himself with merely
detaching a Patrol to watch its movements) along a narrow cross road,
running nearly parallel with the Charleroi high road, and leading
through the Villages of Glabbaix, Maransart, Aywiers, Frischermont,
Smohain, and Verd Cocou. Here <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s Brigade arrived in the
evening, in the vicinity of the Forest of Soignies, and bivouacked;
while <span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span>'s Brigade passed the night somewhat nearer to
the ground which had been selected for the position to be taken up by
the Anglo-Allied Army.</p>

<p>The Right Cavalry Column, consisting only, as previously stated, of the
1st and 2nd Light Dragoons of the King's German Legion, and of the 15th
British Hussars, effected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span> its retreat in good order, protected by its
Skirmishers, as far as the ford, which it crossed above Genappe. At
this point, the French Cavalry suspended its pursuit, and proceeded,
in like manner as that on the right had done, to join the main body on
the high road; while the British Right Cavalry Column continued its
retreat unmolested towards the position of Waterloo, in rear of which
it bivouacked.</p>

<p>A large body of French Cavalry, consisting of from sixteen to eighteen
Squadrons, was now entering Genappe by the Charleroi road, followed by
the main body of the French Army under <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>.</p>

<p>The Earl of <span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span>, who was desirous of checking the Enemy's
advance, so as to gain sufficient time for the orderly retreat of the
Anglo-Allied Army, and to prevent a compromise of any portion of the
rearmost troops, decided upon embracing the advantage which the narrow
Defile of Genappe seemed to present in aid of his design. The town
consists mainly of houses lining the high road, on the Brussels side of
the Bridge. The road then ascends a ridge, the brow of which is about
six or seven hundred yards distant, and here Lord <span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span>
had halted the Heavy Brigades of Lord <span class="smcap">Edward Somerset</span> and
of Sir <span class="smcap">William Ponsonby</span>, and posted them so as to cover the
retirement of the Light Cavalry. At first, he formed them in line;
<span class="smcap">Somerset</span>'s on the right, and <span class="smcap">Ponsonby</span>'s on the left,
of the high road; but observing by the Enemy's formidable advance, that
the Light Cavalry would soon be compelled to fall back, his Lordship
drew up <span class="smcap">Somerset</span>'s Brigade in a Column of half Squadrons upon,
but close to, the right of the road itself, so as to admit of troops
retiring by its left; and formed <span class="smcap">Ponsonby</span>'s Brigade into a
Column of Half Squadrons upon the left of the high road, and somewhat
to the rear. The 7th Hussars were formed at some little distance in
the rear of Genappe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span> and the 23rd Light Dragoons were drawn up in
support of that Regiment, and about midway between it and the Heavy
Cavalry on the Height. The Squadron of the 7th Hussars, under Major
<span class="smcap">Hodge</span>, it will be recollected, was halted between the main
body of that Regiment and the town of Genappe.</p>

<p>Thus posted, the Centre retiring Cavalry Column remained about twenty
minutes, when loud shouts announced that the French had entered the
town. Presently a few horsemen appeared galloping out of the street,
and dashed at speed into Major <span class="smcap">Hodge</span>'s Squadron. They were
found, on being taken, to be quite inebriated. In a few moments
afterwards, the French Column showed its head within the town; the
leading Troop consisted of Lancers, all very young men, mounted on very
small horses, and commanded by a fine looking, and, as it subsequently
appeared, a very brave man. The Column remained about fifteen minutes
within the town, its head halted at the outlet facing the British Rear
Guard, and its flanks protected by the houses. The street not being
straight, and the rear of the Column not being aware that the front
had halted, continued pressing forward, until the whole mass became
so jammed that it was impossible for the foremost ranks to go about,
should such a movement become necessary.</p>

<p>Their apparent hesitation and indecision induced Lord
<span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span>, who stood upon some elevated ground adjoining the
right of the road, to order the 7th Hussars to charge. The latter,
animated by the presence of the Commander of the Cavalry, who was also
their own Colonel, rushed forward with the most determined spirit and
intrepidity; while the French, awaiting the onslaught, opposed to them
a close, compact, and impenetrable phalanx of lances; which, being
securely flanked by the houses, and backed by a solid mass of horsemen,
presented a complete <i>chevaux de frise</i>. Hence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span> it is not surprising
that the charge should have made no impression upon the Enemy;
nevertheless, the contest was maintained for some considerable time;
the Hussars cutting at their opponents, and the latter parrying and
thrusting, neither party giving way a single inch of ground; both the
Commanding Officer of the Lancers, and Major <span class="smcap">Hodge</span>, commanding
the leading Squadron of the Hussars, were killed, gallantly fighting to
the last.</p>

<p>The French had by this time established a Battery of Horse Artillery
on the left of Genappe and upon the opposite bank of the river, from
which they opened a brisk fire upon the British Cavalry in support, and
several shot struck the main body of the 7th Hussars, upsetting men
and horses, and causing great impediments in their rear. The French
Lancers now advanced, and drove the 7th Hussars upon their Reserve; but
here the 7th rallied, renewed their attack, and forced back the Lancers
upon the town. The latter having been reinforced, rallied, in their
turn, and drove back the Hussars. These, however, again rallied, and
resolutely faced their opponents, with whom they gallantly continued
a fierce encounter for some time longer, when to terminate a conflict
which was most obstinate and sanguinary without being productive of
any favourable result, but in which the bravery of the 7th Hussars
shone most conspicuously, and became the theme of admiration of all
who witnessed it, Lord <span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span> decided upon withdrawing that
Regiment and charging with the 1st Life Guards. As soon as the Hussars
went about, in pursuance of the Orders received, the Lancers followed
them. In the <i>mêlée</i> which ensued, the French lost quite as many men as
did the Hussars; and when at length the latter were able to disengage
themselves, the former did not attempt to follow them. The 7th retired
through the 23rd Light Dragoons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span> took the first favourable turn off
the road and reformed in the adjoining field.</p>

<p>During this contest, the French, having become sensible of the evil
that might arise from the closely wedged state of the Cavalry in the
town, began to clear the rear of the most advanced portions of the
Column, so as to admit of more freedom of movement in case of disaster.
A Battery of British Horse Artillery had taken post close to a house on
the Height occupied by the Heavy Cavalry, and on the left of the road;
and it was now replying to the French Battery on the opposite bank of
the river.</p>

<p>So exceedingly elated were the French with having repulsed the 7th
Hussars in this their first serious encounter with the British Cavalry,
that immediately on that Regiment retiring, the whole Column that
was in Genappe raised the war cry, and rent the air with shouts of
"<i>En avant!</i>&mdash;<i>En avant!</i>" evincing the greatest impatience to follow
up this momentary advantage, and to attack the Supports; for which,
indeed, the opportunity appeared very favourable, as the ranks of the
latter were suffering considerable annoyance from the well directed and
effective fire of the French guns on the opposite bank of the river.</p>

<p>They now abandoned the secure cover to which they had been indebted
for their temporary success, and were advancing up the ascent with
all the confidence of a fancied superiority, when the Earl of
<span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span>, seizing upon the advantage presented for attacking
them while moving up hill, with their Flanks unsupported, and a narrow
Defile in their rear, and being also desirous of affording the 1st
Life Guards an opportunity of charging, brought forward that Regiment
through the 23rd Light Dragoons, who opened out for its passage to the
front. The Life Guards now made their charge, most gallantly headed by
Colonel Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span> <span class="smcap">John Elley</span>, Deputy Adjutant General, who, at the
moment of contact with the Enemy, began by cutting down two men right
and left. It was truly a splendid charge; its rapid rush down into
the Enemy's mass, was as terrific in appearance as it was destructive
in its effect; for although the French met the attack with firmness,
they were utterly unable to hold their ground a single moment, were
overthrown with great slaughter, and literally ridden down in such a
manner that the road was instantaneously covered with men and horses,
scattered in all directions. The Life Guards, pursuing their victorious
course, dashed into Genappe, and drove all before them as far as the
opposite outlet of the town.</p>

<p>This brilliant and eminently successful charge made a deep impression
upon the Enemy, who now conducted his pursuit with extreme caution. The
23rd Light Dragoons, which had supported the 1st Life Guards in their
charge, became again the last Regiment in the Rear Guard, and continued
so during the remainder of the retreat. <span class="smcap">Ponsonby</span>'s Brigade had
deployed to the right of the high road, and the guns were so disposed
as to take advantageous positions, retiring <i>en échiquier</i>.</p>

<p>The Enemy, after quitting Genappe, tried to get upon the Flanks of
the Centre retiring Column, chiefly upon the Right Flank; but the
Royals, Greys, and Inniskillings, man&oelig;uvred beautifully; retiring
by alternate Squadrons, and covered by their own Skirmishers, who
completely beat the French Light Cavalry in that kind of warfare.
Finding that from the deep state of the ground, there was not the
least danger of his being turned by the Enemy, Lord <span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span>
gradually withdrew <span class="smcap">Ponsonby</span>'s Brigade to the high road. He
kept the Light Cavalry, protected by the Household Brigade, as the
Rear Guard, and slowly retired into the chosen position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span> in front
of Waterloo, the guns and rockets constantly plying the Enemy's
Advance, which, although it pressed forward twice or thrice, and made
preparations to attack, never ventured to come to close quarters with
its opponents; and the Column received from it no further molestation.</p>

<p>On arriving at the foot of the Anglo-Allied position, the 23rd Light
Dragoons moved off to the (Allied) right of the high road, and into
the hollow in which lies the Orchard of the Farm of La Haye Sainte.
Here they were drawn up, prepared to meet the French Advanced Guard,
should it follow them, or to fall upon its Flank, should it venture to
continue its march along the road. The latter, however, halted upon the
Height which intervenes between La Haye Sainte and La Belle Alliance,
and opened a fire upon the Centre of the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s
Line, above the former Farm, from two Batteries of Horse Artillery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Picton</span>, who was then upon the rising ground in rear of La
Haye Sainte, and who was intently watching the Enemy's advance along
the high road, perceived Columns of Infantry advancing from La Belle
Alliance. He immediately took upon himself to unite the two Batteries
nearest at hand, which were those under Major <span class="smcap">Lloyd</span> of the
British Artillery, and Major <span class="smcap">Cleeves</span> of the King's German
Legion (although not belonging to his own Division), and to place them
in position on the high ground close to the Charleroi road. The guns
immediately opened a brisk cannonade upon the French Columns, of which
they had obtained a most accurate range just as their leading Divisions
had entered the inclosed space between the high banks which line the
high road where it is cut through the Height before mentioned as
intervening between La Belle Alliance and La Haye Sainte. This mass of
the Enemy's Infantry suffered severely from the fire, to which it stood
exposed about half an hour: for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span> the head of the Column having been
unable to retrograde, in consequence of the pressure from its rear, and
prevented by the high bank on either side of the road from filing off
to a flank, could not readily extricate itself from so embarrassing a
situation.</p>

<p>During the whole of this fire, the Allied Batteries were replied
to, though very ineffectually, by the two Batteries of French Horse
Artillery posted on the Height in question.</p>

<p>It was now twilight: the approaching darkness was greatly accelerated
by the lowering aspect of the sky. Picquets were hastily thrown forward
by both Armies, and to so great a height had the mutual spirit of
defiance arisen, that the near approach of opposing parties, advancing
to take up their ground for the night, led to little Cavalry affairs,
which, though unproductive of any useful result to either side, were
distinguished, on different points of the Lines, by a chivalrous
bravery which seemed to require a prudent restraint.</p>

<p>In one of these affairs, Captain <span class="smcap">Heyliger</span> of the 7th Hussars,
made a very brilliant charge with his Troop; and when the Duke of
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span> sent to check him, his Grace desired to be made
acquainted with the name of an Officer who had displayed so much
gallantry. A very spirited charge was also made by the Right Troop of
the 2nd Light Dragoons of the King's German Legion, under Lieutenant
<span class="smcap">Hugo</span>; who was allowed by his Commanding Officer to volunteer
for that service, and who, from the vicinity of Hougomont, boldly
rushed up the Height intervening between that point and Mon Plaisir,
and gallantly drove back a portion of the French Advanced Guard of
Cavalry; recapturing at the same time three carriages filled with
British sick and wounded.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The manner in which the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> withdrew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span> his Army
from the position of Quatre Bras to the one of Waterloo, must ever
render that retreat a perfect model of operations of this nature,
performed in the immediate presence of a powerful Enemy. Those
dispositions which have been described as having been made by him for
the purpose of masking the retirement of the main body, of affording
perfect security to the passage of the Defile in his rear, and of
ensuring the orderly and regular assembly of the several Corps on
the ground respectively allotted to them in the new position, evince
altogether a degree of skill which has never been surpassed.</p>

<p>In such operations, the covering of the Army by its Cavalry and
Light Troops necessarily forms an important feature; and a glance
at the manner in which this duty was fulfilled by the Earl of
<span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span>, with the Cavalry, Horse Artillery, and a few
Light Battalions, at his disposal, is sufficient to show that the
exemplification of such feature on this occasion was exceedingly
beautiful. Indeed, so orderly and so perfect were all the arrangements
connected with this retreat, from its commencement to its close, that
the movements partook more of the appearance of a Field Day upon a
large scale, than of an operation executed in the actual presence of an
Enemy; and this was particularly observable as regarded the protection
afforded by the Cavalry and Horse Artillery, which man&oelig;uvred to
admiration, and in a style that, combined with the brilliant charge by
the 1st Life Guards at Genappe, evidently impressed the Enemy with a
due sense of the efficiency of the gallant troops immediately in his
front. It may here also be remarked, that the judicious dispositions
made by Lord <span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span> in covering this retreat, and the high
degree of confidence with which he inspired the Cavalry, afforded well
grounded anticipations of the success likely to attend his measures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
when conducting that Cavalry in the open battle field, on which, it
was foreseen, its prowess would so very soon be tested. The British
and German portion of the Cavalry was in excellent order, and seemed
already to have imbibed, in a high degree, that gallant bearing and
chivalrous spirit, which it beheld and admired in its distinguished
Chief.</p>

<p>In the course of the evening, the Duke received from Prince
<span class="smcap">Blücher</span> a reply to the request he had made for his support in
the position he was now occupying. It was highly characteristic of the
old man, who had written it, in the following terms, without previously
conferring with, or addressing himself to, any one:&mdash;"I shall not come
with two Corps only, but with my whole Army; upon this understanding,
however, that should the French not attack us on the 18th, we shall
attack them on the 19th."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Duke, who, as has already been explained, had, from the
commencement of the Campaign, considered it very possible that
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> would advance by the Mons road, still entertained
apprehensions of an attempt on the part of his opponent to turn him by
Hal, and seize Brussels by a <i>coup de main</i>. For this, however, he was
fully prepared, having made his dispositions for the security of that
Flank, in the manner pointed out in the following instructions, which
he issued to Major General the Hon. Sir <span class="smcap">Charles Colville</span>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-left:75%;" >

"17th June 1815.<br />
</p>

<p>"The Army retired this day from its position at Quatre Bras to its
present position in front of Waterloo.</p>

<p>"The Brigades of the Fourth Division, at Braine le Comte, are to
retire at daylight tomorrow morning upon Hal.</p>

<p>"Major General <span class="smcap">Colville</span> must be guided by the intelligence
he receives of the Enemy's movements in his march to Hal, whether he
moves by the direct route or by Enghien.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p>"Prince <span class="smcap">Frederick</span> of Orange is to occupy with his Corps the
position between Hal and Enghien, and is to defend it as long as
possible.</p>

<p>"The Army will probably continue in its position in front of Waterloo
tomorrow.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Torrens</span> will inform Lieutenant General
Sir <span class="smcap">Charles Colville</span> of the position and situation of the
Armies."</p></blockquote>

<p>The respective lines of Picquets and Vedettes had scarcely been taken
up along the low ground that skirted the front of the Anglo-Allied
position, and the last gun had just boomed from the Heights, when
"heaven's artillery," accompanied by vivid flashes of lightning, again
peeled forth in solemn and awful grandeur; while the rain, pouring down
in torrents, imparted the utmost gloom and discomfort to the bivouacs,
which the opposing Armies had established for the night, upon the
ground destined to become celebrated in history, even to the remotest
ages.</p>

<p class="drop">IT was not until the night of the 16th, after <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s and
<span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s <i>Corps d'Armée</i> had retired to Tilly and Gentinnes,
that it was decided the Prussian Army should retreat upon Wavre.
This decision was communicated in the Orders then transmitted from
the Prussian Head Quarters to the First and Second <i>Corps d'Armée</i>
(<span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s and <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s) directing them to bivouac at
Bierge and St Anne, in the vicinity of Wavre; as also in the Orders
forwarded, on the next morning, to the bivouacs of the Third and Fourth
Corps (<span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s and <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s), at Gembloux and
Basse Bodecée, directing them to fall back, and bivouac at La Bavette
and Dion le Mont near Wavre.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s and <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s Corps retired by Mont St
Guibert, in rear of which Defile the latter Corps remained a
considerable time as Rear Guard, while the former marched on to
<span class="smcap">Wavre</span>, where it arrived about midday, crossed the Dyle, and
took up its position at Bierge. <span class="smcap">Pirch</span> followed the same route,
but took post on the right bank of the Dyle, between St Anne and
Aisemont.</p>

<p>With the first glimmering of daylight the troops, which, under the
command of General <span class="smcap">Jagow</span>, had continued in full possession
of Bry and its immediate vicinity during the night, began to retire,
firstly, in the direction of Sombref, and thence to Gembloux, which
they reached before the arrival of <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s Corps. After
the receipt of the Order pointing out the direction of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span> retreat,
<span class="smcap">Jagow</span> conducted these troops, in the course of the 17th,
towards their respective Brigades.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Sohr</span>, whose Cavalry Brigade with half
a Horse Battery, formed the Rear Guard of the line of retreat of
<span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s and <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s Corps, received Orders to take
up a concealed position between Tilly and Gentinnes, thence to watch
the movements of the Enemy; and, as soon as he found himself pressed by
the latter, to fall back upon the Defile of Mont St Guibert.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>, who, it will be recollected, had received a
message from <span class="smcap">Gneisenau</span>, leaving it optional with him to retire
by Tilly or Gembloux, according to circumstances, decided on falling
back upon the latter point; being well aware that the Enemy was in
possession of the Villages of St Amand and Ligny, and of the Field of
Battle to within a very short distance from Sombref.</p>

<p>He had collected together his widely disseminated Brigades, and drawn
in his Advanced Posts; an operation which, executed in the darkness of
the night, retarded his departure so much that it was two o'clock in
the morning before the Reserve Artillery, which formed the head of the
Column, struck into the road which at Point du Jour, leads from the
Namur <i>chaussée</i> to Gembloux. The Rear Guard of this line of retreat,
which consisted of the Ninth Infantry Brigade, under Major General
<span class="smcap">Borcke</span>, and the Reserve Cavalry, under General <span class="smcap">Hobe</span>,
and was drawn up along the Namur road, having in its front the Fleurus
<i>chaussée</i>, leading directly towards the Enemy, did not commence its
march until after four o'clock, when the sun had risen. The main body
of the Corps reached Gembloux at six o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>On approaching this place, <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span> learned that
<span class="smcap">Bülow</span> had posted the Fourth Corps about three miles
in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span> rear of Gembloux, upon the old Roman road; whereupon Major
<span class="smcap">Weyrach</span>, Aide de Camp to Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, who had
continued with <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span> during the night of the 16th, set
off to seek out the Field Marshal, and to report to him the position
and attendant circumstances of the Third and Fourth <i>Corps d'Armée</i>.
He soon succeeded in discovering the Prussian Head Quarters at
Mélioreux, and communicated the above important information to Count
<span class="smcap">Gneisenau</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thielemann</span> gave his own Corps a halt on the other side of the
town, in order that his troops might obtain rest and refreshment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Advance of <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Corps had reached Basse Bodecée, upon
the old Roman road, at nightfall of the 16th of June. Here that General
became acquainted with the loss of the Battle of Ligny: whereupon he
ordered the Brigades of his Corps to be posted at intervals along this
road, with the exception of the Thirteenth (under Lieutenant General
<span class="smcap">Hake</span>), which was directed to bivouac more to the rear, near
Hottoment, where the same road is intersected by that which conducts
from Namur to Louvain.</p>

<p>Both Corps remained for some hours in a state of uncertainty as to the
direction to be taken for forming a junction with the First and Second
Corps. <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span> wrote to <span class="smcap">Bülow</span> that he had received
no Orders from Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, but that he presumed the
retreat was upon St Trond. He also stated that he had not been followed
by the Enemy, but that he had heard distant firing on the right, which
he concluded was connected with the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Army.</p>

<p>At length, about half past nine o'clock, Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s Aide
de Camp, Major <span class="smcap">Weyrach</span>, arrived at <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
Quarters, and brought the Orders for the retreat of the Fourth Corps
to Dion le Mont, near Wavre, by Walhain and Corbaix. The Orders also
required that <span class="smcap">Bülow</span> should post the main body of his Rear
Guard (which consisted of the Fourteenth Brigade) at Vieux Sart; as
also that he should send a Detachment, consisting of one Regiment of
Cavalry, two Battalions of Infantry, and two guns of Horse Artillery,
to the Defile of Mont St Guibert, to act, in the first instance as a
Support to Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Sohr</span>, who was at Tilly, and
then, upon the latter falling back, to act as Rear Guard in this
direction. Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Ledebur</span> was accordingly detached
upon this duty with the 10th Hussars, the Fusilier Battalions of the
11th Regiment of Infantry and 1st Regiment of Pomeranian Landwehr,
together with two guns from the Horse Battery No. 12. The Corps itself
moved directly upon Dion le Mont, and on reaching the Height near that
town, on which is situated the public house of <i>A tous vents</i>, took up
a position close to the intersection of the roads leading to Louvain,
Wavre, and Gembloux.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At two o'clock in the afternoon, <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span> commenced his
march upon Wavre; where the Corps arrived late in the evening, and
took up its position at La Bavette, leaving the Ninth Infantry Brigade
(General <span class="smcap">Borcke</span>) and the Cavalry Brigade of Colonel Count
<span class="smcap">Lottum</span>, on the right bank of the Dyle. In this position the
Corps was now rejoined by Colonel <span class="smcap">Marwitz</span>' Cavalry Brigade,
which had retired by Tilly; as also by the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd
Kurmark Landwehr, and the two Squadrons of the 6th Kurmark Landwehr
Cavalry, which troops had been left at Dinant. The Squadron of the 7th
Uhlans that had been detached to Onoz, also joined, but having fallen
in with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span> superior force of the Enemy's Cavalry, had experienced a
great loss. The two Squadrons of the 9th Hussars, belonging to this
Corps, had not yet arrived from Ciney.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Prussian Head Quarters were established, early on the 17th, at
Wavre. The veteran Field Marshal, who was still suffering considerably
in consequence of his fall, was obliged to seek rest the moment he
arrived there, and did not quit his bed during the remainder of the day.</p>

<p>In the course of the forenoon, Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Massow</span>, who had
been despatched with a message to the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>,
returned with the one from his Grace, communicating the intention
of the latter to fall back upon Waterloo and accept a battle there,
provided he received the support of two Prussian Corps. (See page 264.)
There was every disposition to enter into this proposal, but some
degree of uncertainty existed as to whether <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Corps
would join the Army on the 17th, as also a certain misgiving respecting
the Park of Ammunition of both <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s and <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s
Corps, which had been directed upon Gembloux, a circumstance that
excited apprehensions as to the possibility of furnishing the much
needed supply of ammunition to these Corps which were at hand. In this
state of uncertainty, no other resolution could be adopted than that
of holding the position in front and in rear of the Dyle (with the
Advanced Guard of the Fourth Corps as far forward as Mont St Guibert),
until the required ammunition should be obtained; and <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>
deferred replying to <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s communication, in the
hope that his Army would very soon be relieved from the unpleasant
circumstances above mentioned.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While the Prussians were thus effecting their retreat in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span> good order,
along the cross roads of that part of the country (high road there
was none), no corresponding activity manifested itself on the part
of the French, whom the morning's dawn found still lying in their
bivouac. Their Vedettes stood within half a mile of the Columns of
<span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s Rear Guard; the retreat of which, not having
commenced until after sunrise, might have been easily remarked: and had
the French detached but the smallest Patrol, they could not have failed
to discover the direction of that retreat&mdash;whether towards Namur or
Gembloux.</p>

<p>It was not until after <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span> had retired a sufficient
distance to escape further notice that any disposition for movement
occurred to disturb the perfect quietude of their repose. Then,
<span class="smcap">Pajol</span> with a Division of his Light Cavalry Corps, under
Lieutenant General Baron <span class="smcap">Soult</span>, consisting of the 1st, 4th,
and 5th Hussars, was detached in pursuit of the Prussians. He struck
into the Namur road, and shortly afterwards Lieutenant General Baron
<span class="smcap">Teste</span>'s Infantry Division of <span class="smcap">Lobau</span>'s Corps (the
Sixth), followed in support, and took up a position on the Heights of
Mazy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pajol</span> had not proceeded very far when he perceived a Prussian
Battery retiring upon Namur, which he lost no time in capturing and
forwarding to Head Quarters; where the circumstance strengthened
the belief that <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> had retreated by that road. It was
the Prussian Horse Battery No. 14, belonging to the Second Corps,
which, having towards the end of the Battle expended every shot, had
driven off the Field to procure a fresh supply of ammunition, but
had not succeeded in falling in with the Reserve Ammunition Waggons.
The Battery neither returned to its own Corps, nor did it comply
with <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s express Order to march upon Gembloux, but
consumed much time in uselessly driving first in one direction, and
then in another. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span> was accompanied at this moment by a Squadron of
the 7th Prussian Uhlans, which the Third Corps had neglected to recall
from Onoz. The Squadron retired on the approach of the French Cavalry,
and escaped with a loss of 30 men; but all the guns fell into the hands
of the Enemy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pajol</span>, feeling at last some reason to doubt that Namur
was a point in the Prussian retreat, diverged from the high road,
and proceeded to St Denis, where he was joined by <span class="smcap">Teste</span>'s
Division. A Brigade of <span class="smcap">Excelmans</span>' Cavalry Corps had been
detached to offer support to <span class="smcap">Pajol</span>, should the latter require
it; but in consequence of certain information, gained upon the road, it
was subsequently directed to proceed towards Gembloux, on approaching
which it discovered traces of the Prussian retreat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>, who commanded the Right Wing of the French Army in
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s absence, repaired early in the morning to the
Emperor's Quarters at Fleurus, for instructions, according to an Order
he had received to that effect on the previous evening. He was desired
to wait and accompany the Emperor, who was going to visit the Field of
Battle. The latter, however, did not start from Fleurus until between
eight and nine o'clock, and on reaching St Amand, he examined the
approaches by which this Village had been attacked the day before;
then, he rode about the Field, gave directions for the care of the
wounded; and, as he passed in front of different Regiments, that were
falling in without arms on the ground where they were bivouacked, he
was received with loud cheers. He addressed himself to nearly all the
Corps, and assured them of the lively satisfaction he had felt on
witnessing their conduct in the battle. Having dismounted, he conversed
freely, and at great length, with <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> and <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>,
on the state of public opinion in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span> Paris, the different political
parties, and on various other subjects quite unconnected with those
military operations upon the successful issue of which depended the
stability of his present power.</p>

<p>That <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> should have neglected to follow up the
advantages which fortune had thrown in his way on the morning of the
17th of June, is quite incomprehensible. With the exception of a
Prussian Picquet at Gentinnes, his whole front as far as Gembloux, was
perfectly clear of an Enemy. <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> was still in position
at Quatre Bras, where his Left had become exposed by the retreat of
the Prussians, and in rear of which point was the Defile of Genappe.
There was nothing to prevent <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> from marching directly
upon that Defile; and supporting, by a vigorous attack upon the
Anglo-Allied Left and Rear, a simultaneous movement against the Front
by the force under <span class="smcap">Ney</span>. Whither had fled the mighty spirit
which had shone forth with such dazzling brilliancy in former Wars,
and which had never displayed the energy of its powers of combination,
and activity in following up successes, more eminently than in the
Campaign of the previous year? When before did he omit pressing every
advantage to the utmost, or neglect to seize that moment of time, in
which, having defeated one portion of his Enemies, he was enabled to
fall with combined force upon another? His Army was not more fatigued
than was that of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, which had arrived at Quatre Bras
by forced marches. The troops which he subsequently did lead upon that
point, when it was too late, consisting chiefly of the Imperial Guard
and the Sixth Corps, were comparatively fresh. The former had not been
engaged at Ligny until towards the termination of the action, when
they suffered scarcely any loss; the latter, which arrived later, had
remained intact. The idea of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span> forming a junction with <span class="smcap">Ney</span>,
with a view of attacking <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, was certainly
entertained; but its execution was most unaccountably and unnecessarily
delayed until its intended effect could not but fall powerless upon a
vigilant Enemy, fully prepared, by having improved the precious moments
of time, thus lost, to detect the purpose of the movement, and to ward
off the intended blow.</p>

<p>With an Army greatly inferior in numbers to the united forces of
his adversaries, <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s prospects of success rested
exclusively upon his utmost skill and address, not only in preventing
that union of force, but also in so planning, arranging, and executing
his combinations, that having succeeded in defeating one opponent with
a superior mass, he might then precipitate himself in like manner
upon another, at the very moment when the latter might be occupied
or engaged with one of his Marshals. This would have exacted of him
the most untiring energy, the application of all his great resources
in strategical science, a lightning-swift decision, and a daring
resolution both in adopting and in executing all his movements. It
was by the exercise of such powerful mental resources as these, that,
unaided by a sufficiently corresponding amount of physical force, he
had conducted the Campaign of 1814; but the spirit by which they were
conceived, and the genius which instinctively seized the means of their
execution, seemed to have abandoned him in this, his last, Campaign:
a faint gleam of the old spirit was visible in its opening movements,
but it was now rather a wildfire, dazzling him for a moment, on the
downward path to his destiny, than the Star which had so often led
him to victory. The last flash of his genius was brief, and, on the
memorable plains of Fleurus, seemed to disappear, and leave him in
utter darkness.</p>

<p>The same fatal inactivity which had marked the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span> Emperor's
proceedings on the evening of the 15th, and during the morning of
the 16th, again manifested itself upon the 17th of June: and it was
not until nearly noon of this day, upon receiving a report of a
reconnaissance, made in the direction of Quatre Bras, and upon learning
that a considerable body of Prussians had been discovered at Gembloux,
that he made any disposition for the movement of his troops, beyond the
previous detaching of <span class="smcap">Pajol</span>'s Light Cavalry in pursuit of the
Prussians along the Namur road.</p>

<p>He now ordered the following troops to proceed to occupy a position in
advance of Marbais, across the Namur road, facing Quatre Bras:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Lobau</span>'s Infantry Corps (the Sixth), with the exception of the
Twenty First Division, under Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">Teste</span>, which
had already been detached in support of <span class="smcap">Pajol</span>;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Milhaud</span>'s Corps of Heavy Cavalry (<i>Cuirassiers</i>), Lieutenant
General Baron <span class="smcap">Subervie</span>'s Light Cavalry Brigade, from
<span class="smcap">Pajol</span>'s Corps;</p>

<p>the Third Light Cavalry Division (belonging to the Third Corps), under
Lieutenant General Baron <span class="smcap">Domon</span>; and the Imperial Guard, both
Cavalry and Infantry.</p></blockquote>

<p>To Marshal <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> he confided the pursuit of the Prussians,
and for this purpose he placed at his disposal as great an extent
of force as his limited means would admit: a force, certainly not
sufficient to enable that Marshal to confront the whole Prussian Army,
should the latter, after having rallied and concentrated its strength,
make a stand against him, but quite so to enable him to watch its
movements, and to man&oelig;uvre so as to maintain his communication
with the main Army, and, if pressed by superior numbers, to effect a
junction with <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

</p>

<p>The Seventh Infantry Division, under Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">Girard</span>
(belonging to the Second Corps) having suffered very severely in the
Battle, was left upon the Field.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s instructions to <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> were extremely
simple and concise: "Pursue the Prussians, complete their defeat by
attacking them as soon as you come up with them, and never let them
out of your sight. I am going to unite the remainder of this portion
of the Army with Marshal <span class="smcap">Ney</span>'s Corps, to march against the
English, and to fight them if they should hold their ground between
this and the Forest of Soignies. You will communicate with me by the
paved road which leads to Quatre Bras." No particular direction was
prescribed, because the Emperor was totally ignorant of the real line
of the Prussian retreat. At the same time he was strongly impressed
with the idea that <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> had retired upon Namur and Liege,
with a view to occupy the line of the Meuse, whence he might seriously
endanger the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span> Right of the French Army, as also its main line of
operation, should it advance upon Brussels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> did not hesitate to remark to the Emperor, that
the Prussians, having commenced their retreat at ten o'clock the
previous night, had gained several hours' start of the troops with
which he was to follow them; that although the reports received from
the Advanced Cavalry conveyed no positive information as to the
direction in which the great mass of the Prussian Army had effected
its retreat, appearances as yet seemed to justify the supposition that
<span class="smcap">Blücher</span> had fallen back upon Namur; and that as he would thus
have to pursue in a direction contrary to that which <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>
was himself going to take, with very little chance of being able to
prevent the execution of any dispositions the Prussians might have
resolved upon when quitting the Field of Battle, he begged to be
allowed to follow the Emperor in his projected movement upon Quatre
Bras.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> declined to entertain this proposition, repeated
the Order he had already given to him, adding that it rested with him
(<span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>) to discover the route taken by the Prussians, whose
defeat he was to complete by attacking them the moment he came up with
them; while he himself would proceed to fight the English.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Order was immediately given for the advance of the troops
previously assembled near Marbais, preceded by <span class="smcap">Subervie</span>'s
Division of Light Cavalry, as Advanced Guard. By the time they
reached Quatre Bras, which was about two o'clock, the whole of
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Infantry had crossed the Genappe, and was
retiring along the high road to Brussels, protected by the Cavalry,
which was now pressed by the French, in the manner described in the
preceding Chapter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>The march of the French troops through Bry, in the direction of
Quatre Bras, became known to the Prussians through Lieutenant Colonel
<span class="smcap">Sohr</span>, who still held his Cavalry Brigade, even at this time,
posted in rear of Tilly. Shortly afterwards, some of the French
Cavalry having approached, he began to retire slowly towards Mont
St Guibert, and, as he frequently formed up, in wait for the Enemy,
he did not reach that point until the evening of the 17th. Here he
found Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Ledebur</span>, who had arrived with his
Detachment, and had received Orders to maintain the Defile.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Upon the departure of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> ordered
<span class="smcap">Vandamme</span> and <span class="smcap">Gérard</span> to get their Corps under arms,
and to move them, in the first instance, to the junction of the
Gembloux road with that to Namur; and having subsequently received
intelligence that a considerable body of Prussians had passed through
the former town, he desired that those two Corps should continue their
movement upon that point. In the mean time, he repaired to the Advanced
Posts of <span class="smcap">Excelmans</span>' Dragoons, which were by this time beyond
Gembloux. It was part of this Cavalry which followed Lieutenant Colonel
<span class="smcap">Sohr</span>, on the left. They merely threw out Skirmishers against
him; and, as night set in, they abandoned the pursuit in this direction.</p>

<p>The Corps of <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span> and <span class="smcap">Gérard</span> did not reach
Gembloux until very late in the evening. The former was posted in
advance, the latter, in rear, of the town; near which also, and on
the right bank of the Ormeau, was stationed the Sixth Light Cavalry
Division, under General <span class="smcap">Vallin</span>, who succeeded to the command,
upon Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">Maurin</span> being wounded at the Battle
of Ligny. The First Brigade of Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">Chastel</span>'s
Tenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span> Cavalry Division, consisting of the 4th and 12th Dragoons, under
General <span class="smcap">Bonnemain</span>, was pushed on to Sart à Wallain, and the
15th Dragoons (from General <span class="smcap">Vincent</span>'s Brigade of the Ninth
Cavalry Division, under Lieutenant General Baron <span class="smcap">Soult</span>), were
detached to Perwès. From both these points, reports were sent into
Gembloux that the Prussians had retired upon Wavre.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pajol</span>, with his Light Cavalry and <span class="smcap">Teste</span>'s Infantry
Division, had returned from St Denis, between Namur and Gembloux, to
the original position occupied by the latter in the morning, at Mazy,
in the immediate vicinity of the Field of Ligny; a movement for which
no satisfactory cause has ever been assigned.</p>

<p>The extent of information obtained by <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> concerning the
Prussian retreat, and the nature of the dispositions which he adopted
in consequence, will be best explained by the following despatch which
he addressed to the Emperor:&mdash;</p>

<p>Although the information conveyed in this despatch was incorrect on
some points, and imperfect on others, inasmuch as it represented that
Prussian Columns had retired upon Namur and Perwès, which was not the
case, and gave no account of the Columns (First and Second Corps) which
had retreated by Tilly and Gentinnes, still it was well calculated to
satisfy <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, that at least the spirit of his instructions
had been understood by the Marshal. The latter had stated that he
suspected a portion of the Prussian troops was proceeding to join
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, and that, should he ascertain, through his Cavalry
detached to Sart à Wallain and Perwès, that the great mass of the
Prussians was retiring upon Wavre, it was his intention to pursue them
in that direction, "so as to prevent them from reaching Brussels, and
to keep them separated from <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>."</p>

<p>Four hours afterwards (that is, at two o'clock on the morning of the
18th) he sent off another despatch to the Emperor, reporting that he
had decided on marching upon either Corbaix or Wavre.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The retreat of the Prussian Army, after its defeat at Ligny on
the 16th of June, was conducted with great skill, and executed in
very good order. By detaining <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s Corps upon the
Field of Battle until the morning of the 17th, ample security was
afforded to the line of retreat by Gembloux; and by not withdrawing
<span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Corps from that town until <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span> drew
near to it, the distance between the main bodies of these two Corps
became so limited as to present the ready means of opposing their
combined force to a vigorous pursuit should such be attempted.</p>

<p>By the evening of the 17th, the entire Prussian Army (with the
exception of the Ninth and Thirteenth Brigades,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span> and the Reserve
Cavalry of the Third Corps, which arrived by six o'clock on the
following morning) had assembled in the immediate vicinity of
Wavre&mdash;two Corps on the right, and the remaining two Corps on the
left, bank of the Dyle&mdash;in perfect order, and fully prepared to resume
the offensive. Upon the two lines of retreat, the Rear Guards were
well disposed at Vieux Sart and Mont St Guibert; where they continued
during that night, and whence they retired leisurely on the following
day. On the Prussian Left, Patrols were despatched towards the main
road leading from Namur to Louvain. On the Right, a Detachment was
sent from <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Corps to Limale, on the left bank of
the Dyle, to cover the Flank, and Patrols were pushed higher up
the river, to communicate with the Post of Mont St Guibert. Major
<span class="smcap">Falkenhausen</span> had been detached, during the day, to Seroulx for
the purpose of reconnoitring the country in the vicinity of Genappe,
and of the high road to Brussels; and he succeeded in discovering, from
the wooded tracts beyond Seroulx, the advance of the French Army along
the <i>chaussée</i>. Patrols were also detached towards Lasne, Couture, and
Aywiers, to observe the Defiles along the rivulet of the Lasne.</p>

<p>Such were the dispositions of the defeated Prussians on the evening of
the 17th, while the victorious French had not advanced beyond Gembloux.
The former had fallen back, in good order, upon a line with, and a
short distance from, the Anglo-Allied Army on their Right; while their
opponents, though encountering no obstacle of importance, had made but
little progress, and were widely diverging from, instead of closely
co-operating with, the main Army from which they had been detached.
These dispositions, so ably planned and so efficiently performed,
were well calculated to facilitate the grand operation of the morrow,
namely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span> <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s flank movement to the right, to effect a
junction with <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>.</p>

<p>The retreat to Wavre did not in any way incapacitate the Prussian Army
for the resumption of actively offensive operations. With respect
to its material, it so happened that the Park of Reserve Ammunition
Waggons had, in the first instance, been directed upon Gembloux; and
Colonel <span class="smcap">Röhl</span>, who superintended the Ordnance Department of the
Army, sent his Aide de Camp during the night of the 16th to conduct
this Reserve to Wavre; whilst he himself hastened to the latter town,
for the purpose of putting the whole of the Artillery, accordingly
as it arrived there, again in a fit state for action. The supply of
ammunition, however, was necessarily incomplete; but in order to
prevent any failure in this respect, should some mishap occur to
the Park of Reserve Ammunition Waggons, a Courier was despatched to
Maestricht, with directions for the speedy transport of a supply of
ammunition from thence to the Army, by means of the common waggons
of the country. Similar Orders were conveyed to Cologne, Wesel, and
Münster: and, by way of precaution, an express was sent to Liege for
the removal of the Battering Train to Maestricht; as also for the
destruction, in case of danger, of the iron foundry in the Arsenal of
the former place.</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, the Reserve Ammunition Waggons reached Wavre
safely at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 17th. The Corps and
Batteries were furnished with a complete supply of ammunition,
and the Army was thus placed in a perfectly efficient state for
commencing another battle. This turn of affairs was most encouraging,
and <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> delayed not another moment in despatching to
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span> the reply to which allusion has already been made.
(See page 285.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>As regards the influence which the defeat at Ligny exercised over
the <i>morale</i> of the Prussian Army, its injurious effects were made
manifest amongst the newly raised drafts from the Rhenish and
Westphalian Provinces, and from the Duchy of Berg. Of these troops,
8,000 men betook themselves to a flight which admitted of no check
until they reached Liege and Aix la Chapelle. Among the Rhenish
troops, particularly those from Provinces which had formerly belonged
to France, there were many old French soldiers; and although several
of them fought with great bravery, others evinced a bad disposition,
and there were instances in which they passed over to their former
companions in arms. Such, however, was not the case with the troops
from the other western districts of the Prussian State: there was
scarcely a single man amongst the missing, who belonged to any of the
old Westphalian Provinces, Mark, Cleve, Minden, and Ravensberg, whilst
several came from that of Münster.</p>

<p>But the <i>morale</i> of the great mass of the Prussian Army continued
unshaken. The spirit of the troops was neither tamed nor broken; and
their enthusiasm, though damped, had not been subdued. Unbounded
confidence was placed in the firm decision and restless energy of
their aged and venerated Chief; who, though suffering from the effects
of his fall, by which his whole frame had sustained a severe shock,
evinced not the slightest apprehension of fatal consequences to the
Campaign resulting from this defeat. His unbending nature led him
to cast aside for the moment those purely political interests and
theoretically strategical principles, by which a more cautious and
less enterprising Commander might have been induced to secure the
line of the Meuse, and to preserve his direct communications with the
Prussian States, and thus afford but a doubtful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span> and an inefficient
support to his Ally. Placing full reliance on the resources of his own
mind, and on the stern, warlike character of his troops; he devoted
his whole energies to the attainment of the one grand object&mdash;that
of crushing <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> by combining with <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>.
This confidence in himself and in his soldiers was strikingly and
characteristically manifested in the concluding words of a General
Order which he issued to the Army on the morning of the 17th. "I shall
immediately lead you against the Enemy;&mdash;we shall beat him, because it
is our duty to do so."</p>

<p>Towards midnight of the 17th, a communication reached <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>
from General <span class="smcap">Müffling</span> (already mentioned as having been
attached to the British Head Quarters) to the following effect. "The
Anglo-Allied Army is posted with its Right upon Braine l'Alleud, its
Centre upon Mont St Jean, and its Left near La Haye; having the Enemy
in its front. The Duke awaits the attack, but calculates upon Prussian
support."</p>

<p>This intelligence was forwarded, at midnight, to General Count
<span class="smcap">Bülow</span>, accompanied by the following Order:&mdash;"You will
therefore, at daybreak, march with the Fourth Corps from Dion le Mont,
through Wavre, taking the direction of Chapelle St Lambert, in which
vicinity you will keep your force concealed as much as possible, in
case the Enemy should not, by that time, be seriously engaged with the
Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>; but should it be otherwise, you will make
a most vigorous attack upon the Enemy's Right Flank. The Second Corps
will follow you as a direct Support: the First and Third Corps will
also be held in readiness to move in the same direction if necessary.
You will leave a Detachment in observation at Mont St Guibert; which,
if pressed, will gradually fall back upon Wavre. All the Baggage Train,
and everything not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span> actually required in the Field of Action, will be
sent to Louvain."</p>

<p>Instructions, in conformity with the above, were also forwarded to
the Commanders of the other Corps; and a communication of these
arrangements was despatched to General <span class="smcap">Müffling</span>, with an
explanation that the fatigue of the troops could not possibly admit
of earlier support. This General was, at the same time, requested to
forward timely intelligence of the attack upon the Duke, and of the
nature of that attack, that measures might be adopted accordingly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At five o'clock on the morning of the 18th, <span class="smcap">Pajol</span> started
from Mazy, with <span class="smcap">Soult</span>'s Cavalry Division and <span class="smcap">Teste</span>'s
Infantry Division, marching by St Denis and Grand Lez, to Tourinnes;
where he was to await further Orders. At about eight o'clock,
<span class="smcap">Excelmans</span>' Corps of Heavy Cavalry, consisting of eight
Regiments of Dragoons, was put in motion; and at nine o'clock,
<span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>'s and <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>'s Infantry Corps began their
march along one and the same road, by Sart à Wallain, upon Wavre.
The Left of this Column was protected, towards the Dyle, by the
advance of <span class="smcap">Maurin</span>'s Division of Light Cavalry, under General
<span class="smcap">Vallin</span>.</p>

<p>It was about half past ten o'clock, when <span class="smcap">Excelmans</span>' Advanced
Guard came up with the Prussian Rear Guard, on the road to Wavre. He
immediately formed his troops in position, resting their Left upon the
wooded ravine near the Farm of La Plaquerie, and their Right in the
direction of Neuf Sart. While his Skirmishers were engaged with those
of the Enemy, he sent the <i>Chef d'Escadron</i> <span class="smcap">d'Estourmel</span>,
to inform Marshal <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> of what was going on in front,
and also to make known to him that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span> the Prussian Army had continued
its retreat upon Wavre during a part of the night and that morning,
for the purpose of forming a closer communication with the Duke of
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s forces.</p>

<p>The march of the Third and Fourth Corps was greatly retarded by
the bad state of the roads, and frequent halts were occasioned by
the narrowness and miry nature of the Defiles. <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>,
having preceded the Column, reached Sart à Wallain at eleven
o'clock, where he found <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> breakfasting in the house
of M. <span class="smcap">Hollaërt</span>, a Notary. In about half an hour after his
arrival, Colonel <span class="smcap">Simon Lorière</span>, who was acting as his Chief
of the Staff, suddenly heard, while walking in the garden of the
house, a distant but violent cannonade, of which he immediately
went to apprise his General. <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> repaired at once to
the garden, accompanied by <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>, <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>,
<span class="smcap">Excelmans</span>, and several other Officers. He immediately called
for M. <span class="smcap">Hollaërt</span>, and asked him in what part of the country
he considered this tremendous cannonade to be going on. The latter,
pointing to the Forest of Soignies, replied that it must be in the
direction of Planchenoit, Mont St Jean, and that vicinity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gérard</span> then declared his opinion to be in favour of the
expediency of marching in the direction of the cannonade, in order
to connect the movements of the detached force more closely with
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s operations; and offered to lead his own Corps
towards the Battle. This measure was opposed by the Marshal, as
also by General <span class="smcap">Baltus</span>, of the Artillery, who represented
the difficulties of a march in which this Arm might be compromised.
On the other hand, General <span class="smcap">Valaze</span>, Commanding Engineer
of <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>'s Corps, after having coincided in the opinion
expressed by the latter, observed that he had three Companies
of Sappers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span> by aid of which he could remove many obstacles.
<span class="smcap">Gérard</span> then gave his assurance that he could at all events
move on with the gun carriages and limbers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>, however, stated his determination to act in
conformity with his instructions; which were, to pursue and attack
the Prussians, and never to lose sight of them. It had just been
intimated to him that his troops had come up with a Rear Guard of
the Enemy's Infantry, and he did not consider his information was
sufficient to warrant the conclusion that <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> was drawn
up, in expectation of being attacked by him at Wavre; or that he would
continue his retreat upon Brussels; or, that if, in man&oelig;uvring to
effect his junction with <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, he would do so in front,
or in rear, of the Forest of Soignies.</p>

<p>He has since declared, that he did not deem it his duty to follow the
counsel given by <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>, but to attack the Prussians; that
to effect the proposed movement with the whole of his forces would
have been acting contrary to his Orders; that to have detached only a
portion of those forces in the direction of the Forest of Soignies,
would have been to separate the two Corps of his Army by a river, whose
waters were swollen by the rain, and whose banks were swampy, and
thus have rendered their mutual support impossible, however essential
it might have become; finally, that a war of inspiration appertains
alone to the General in Chief, and that his Lieutenants must confine
themselves to that of execution. Hence the march to Wavre was continued.</p>

<p>Whilst proceeding to the Advanced Guard, <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> received the
despatch, dated from the Farm of Caillou, the 18th of June, at ten
o'clock in the morning, acquainting him that the Emperor was going to
attack the Anglo-Allied Army, in its position at Waterloo; desiring him
to direct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span> his movements upon Wavre in such a manner as to draw his
forces nearer to those of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, and, especially, to keep
up a close communication with the latter.</p>

<p>The receipt of these instructions was not followed by any immediate
change in <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s dispositions. He despatched no Cavalry
force&mdash;not even a single Patrol&mdash;to watch any movements that might be
attempted, or actually then in course of execution, by the Prussians,
towards the Field on which the Emperor had intimated to him his
intention of attacking the force under <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>; and hence
it is almost needless to add, that he neglected to establish that close
and active communication with the main Army which was so essentially
important for the accomplishment of the object of the general plan of
operations, and to which <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> had especially directed
his attention in the before mentioned despatch. His sole aim seemed
to be a direct advance upon Wavre; and this he carried into execution
without at all detaching to, or in any way man&oelig;uvring by, his left.
On the contrary, upon arriving in person at the position occupied by
<span class="smcap">Excelmans</span>, he desired the latter to move to his right, and
take post at Dion le Mont; and the ground thus vacated was shortly
afterwards taken up by <span class="smcap">Vallin</span>'s Light Cavalry Division.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At daybreak of the 18th of June, <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>, in conformity with
the Order which he had received during the previous night from
<span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, quitted his position near Dion le Mont, to march
through Wavre to St Lambert. This was the commencement of the important
flank movement of the Prussians in support of the Anglo-Allied Army
in position in front of Waterloo; and every measure of precaution was
adopted with a view to its being carried into effect with certainty and
safety. The sun had not yet risen when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span> Major <span class="smcap">Witowsky</span> was
despatched with a Detachment of the 2nd Silesian Hussars, to Maransart,
for the purpose of closely reconnoitring the Defiles of the Lasne,
which had already been patrolled the evening before, and to observe
the country in front of those Defiles, in the direction of the Enemy's
position. Major <span class="smcap">Falkenhausen</span>, previously mentioned as having
pushed a reconnaissance beyond Seroulx on the 17th, was now directed
also to reconnoitre the Lasne. Scouring parties were sent out, which
kept up the communication that had been opened the previous day with
Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Ledebur</span> at Mont St Guibert: the whole
country between the Dyle and the Charleroi high road was carefully
explored; and correct intelligence was continually sent to the rear
concerning the French Army.</p>

<p>By means of this vigilant look out, the Prussians secured the important
advantage of retarding the communications between the French Emperor
and his Marshal, since it compelled the bearer of despatches to pursue
a very circuitous route.</p>

<p>At half past nine o'clock, on the morning of the 18th, whilst
<span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Corps was on the march to St Lambert, the following
additional despatch was forwarded to General <span class="smcap">Müffling</span>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>

<span style="margin-left:40%;">Wavre, 18th June 1815, at half past nine o'clock.</span>
</p>

<p>"I request you will say to the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, in my
name, that even ill as I am, I shall, nevertheless, put myself at
the head of my troops, for the purpose of immediately attacking the
Enemy's Right Flank, should <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> undertake anything
against the Duke. If, however, the day should pass over without
a hostile attack, it is my opinion that we ought tomorrow, with
our combined forces, to attack the French Army. I commission you
to communicate this as the result of my inward conviction, and to
represent to him that I consider this proposal to be the best and most
suitable in our present position.</p>

<p style="margin-left:60%;">
"<span class="smcap">Blücher.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>The Prussians very soon discovered that the French had made no
disposition whatever for the protection of their Right Flank. Major
<span class="smcap">Witowsky</span> had proceeded as far as Maransart before he fell
in with an Enemy's Patrol; and Major <span class="smcap">Falkenhausen</span> found the
Defiles of the Lasne perfectly free and unobserved. Upon receiving this
intelligence, <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> decided upon supporting the Anglo-Allied
Army, by directing the march of his whole force, or at least of three
Corps, towards the Wood of Paris, and debouching from thence upon the
Flank and Rear of the Enemy; and Major <span class="smcap">Lützow</span> was immediately
despatched for the purpose of narrowly watching, from the other side of
the above Wood, the French movements directed against the position of
the Anglo-Allied Army.</p>

<p>No report as yet had been received from the Rear Guard, concerning
<span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s advance, and as <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s object was now
to gain the Defiles of the Lasne without interruption, and to occupy
in force the Wood of Paris, he determined to avail himself of the
time and opportunity which offered for the projected movement. Being,
however, uncertain as to the amount of <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s force, the
Prince deemed it advisable that Wavre should not be abandoned until
the greater part of the Army had passed the Defiles of St Lambert;
and with this view, he directed that as soon as <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s
Corps should have proceeded beyond Wavre, <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Corps was
to commence its march by Fromont and Ohain to join the Left Wing of
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Army near La Haye. <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s Corps was
ordered to follow <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s in the direction of St Lambert; and
<span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s Corps, after retaining possession of the Defile
of Wavre sufficiently long to render the general movement of the Army
secure, was then gradually to follow <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Corps upon Ohain.</p>

<p>An unfortunate incident occurred during the passage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Corps, through Wavre, which materially impeded the
march of the troops. The Advanced Guard, consisting of the Fifteenth
Brigade (under General <span class="smcap">Losthin</span>), with the 2nd Silesian
Hussars, and a twelve pounder Battery, had scarcely passed through the
town when a fire broke out in the main street, and extended itself with
great rapidity. This not only caused a suspension of the march of the
main body of the Corps, but created much alarm, in consequence of the
great number of ammunition waggons in the place. Every exertion was
made to extinguish the fire. The 1st Battalion of the 14th Regiment,
under Major <span class="smcap">Löwenfeld</span>, and the 7th Pioneer Company, were
ordered upon this duty; and after they had encountered considerable
difficulty, their efforts were crowned with success.</p>

<p>In the mean time the Advanced Guard of <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Corps had
continued its march, and reached St Lambert by eleven o'clock. The
Sixteenth, and then the Thirteenth, Brigade arrived much later; and the
Fourteenth Brigade, which formed the Rear Guard, was a long way behind.
The Advanced Guard did not wait the arrival of the other Brigades, but
proceeded forthwith to cross the Defile of St Lambert. Having effected
the passage, which was attended with great difficulty, in consequence
of the soft and miry state of the valley, it halted in the Wood of
Paris, where it continued a considerable time, waiting for the approach
of the main body. Patrols, however, from the 2nd Silesian Hussars, were
immediately sent forward to feel for the Anglo-Allied Left, and to
reconnoitre the French Right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Corps (the First) commenced its march, upon the left
bank of the Dyle, towards Ohain, about noon.</p>

<p>Whilst <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Reserve Cavalry, following the Thirteenth
Infantry Brigade, was passing through Wavre, French Cavalry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span> had
penetrated between the Rear Guard of this Corps, at Vieux Sart, and
the Detachment under Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Ledebur</span> at Mont St
Guibert. The 2nd Pomeranian, and the 1st Silesian, Landwehr Cavalry
were immediately detached from the Reserve Cavalry of the Corps, to aid
in checking the advance of the Enemy.</p>

<p>The Prussian Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Ledebur</span>, who was still at
Mont St Guibert, having received intelligence of the approach of the
French, decided on commencing his retreat towards Wavre. Lieutenant
Colonel <span class="smcap">Sohr</span>, who had fallen back early in the morning from
Mont St Guibert, sent 150 Cavalry and two guns of Horse Artillery as a
reinforcement to <span class="smcap">Ledebur</span>. The latter now succeeded in forming
a junction with the two Cavalry Regiments detached from the Reserve, as
also, subsequently, with the Cavalry Brigade under <span class="smcap">Sohr</span>, after
a slight affair with the Third French Corps (<span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>'s),
whilst making good his retreat to Auzel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s Corps (the Second) broke up from its position between
St Anne and Aisemont, on the right bank of the Dyle, about noon,
for the purpose of passing the Defile of Wavre. The 1st Battalion
of the 14th Regiment, which occupied this town, was relieved by
a Battalion of the 30th Regiment, belonging to the Third Corps
(<span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s). <span class="smcap">Pirch</span> had just put his Corps in
motion, with a view to cross the Dyle by the town of Wavre, when the
approach of the Enemy was announced. The Defile was crowded with the
troops; the progress of their march could not be otherwise than slow;
and at this moment Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Sohr</span>, whose Brigade
formed the Rear Guard of the Corps, sent in word, that the Enemy
presented a force of six Regiments of Cavalry, ten pieces of Artillery,
and two strong Columns of Infantry.</p>

<p>The Wood of Sarats, close to the Farm of Auzel, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span> now occupied
by some Battalions of the Eighth Brigade, the command of which had
devolved upon Colonel <span class="smcap">Reckow</span>. <span class="smcap">Pirch</span> placed the whole
of the Rear Guard under the Orders of General <span class="smcap">Brause</span>, the
Commander of the Seventh Brigade, and reinforced Lieutenant Colonel
<span class="smcap">Sohr</span> with the 11th Hussars and four pieces of Horse Artillery.
<span class="smcap">Brause</span> posted the remaining Battalions of the Eighth Brigade
in rear of the Wood, and the three Regiments of Cavalry on the right,
with the Foot Battery No. 12 in their front. The Seventh Brigade,
deployed into line, remained in reserve.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Ledebur</span> retired slowly before the
Enemy, and formed a junction with the Eighth Brigade, under Colonel
<span class="smcap">Reckow</span>; who maintained his position until three o'clock in
the afternoon, against the Advanced Guard of <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>'s
Corps. Between three and four o'clock, General <span class="smcap">Brause</span> ordered
the retreat. Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Sohr</span> crossed the Bridge at
the Mill of Bierge, which was occupied by two Companies of the 2nd
Battalion of the 14th Regiment; and then followed the Reserve Cavalry
of <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s Corps, to which his Brigade belonged, but which he
did not overtake until he reached the Field of Waterloo. The Enemy did
not advance with much vigour; the retreat was conducted with perfect
order, and the Fusilier Battalion of the 1st Pomeranian Landwehr, under
Major <span class="smcap">Krüger</span>, distinguished itself on the occasion. After the
passage of the river had been effected, the 1st Battalion of the Elbe
Landwehr remained at Bierge until the Bridge was destroyed and the
Mill set on fire. The 11th Hussars and the 2nd Battalion of the Elbe
Landwehr were posted in observation of the passages across the Dyle,
and did not rejoin the Corps before the following day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blücher</span> had quitted Wavre before eleven o'clock in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span> the
forenoon, and repaired to the vicinity of Limale, in order to make
himself acquainted with the nature of the country in the direction of
St Lambert. Whilst here, he received intelligence of the approach of
the Enemy towards Wavre. Colonel <span class="smcap">Clausewitz</span>, Chief of the
Staff of the Third Corps, was immediately made the bearer of an Order
for <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span> to defend the position at this place, in the
event of the Enemy advancing in force; but, should the latter cross the
Dyle higher up the stream, or not appear in great strength (a point
concerning which nothing positive was then known), he was to leave only
a few Battalions in position at Wavre, and to follow the main Army,
with his Corps, as a Reserve, in the direction of Couture.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s movements, on the 17th and 18th, form so striking
a feature in the history of this Campaign, and exercised so important
an influence upon the fate of the decisive Battle of Waterloo, that it
becomes an essential point in the study of that history, to examine
how far he complied with, and carried into effect, the instructions
received from his Master, and to what degree his proceedings,
consequent upon his ascertaining the direction of the Prussian retreat,
coincided with the general plan and object of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s
operations. On a reference to the account of his transactions during
the 17th, given in the despatch written at ten o'clock on that night,
it appears he was completely ignorant of the line by which the
principal mass of the Prussian Army had retreated, namely, that of
Tilly and Gentinnes, by <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s and <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s Corps,
although his Cavalry had driven back the Prussian Detachment from
the latter place to Mont St Guibert, but from whence it appears to
have been withdrawn in the night. His attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span> seems to have been
much less devoted to this quarter than it was to his Right, in which
direction he detached as far as Perwès. The main body of his forces
did not proceed further than Gembloux on the 17th, that is, about five
miles from the Field of Ligny.</p>

<p>Upon a first consideration, we are strongly impressed by the striking
contrast between this march, in pursuit of a defeated Army, which
had commenced its retreat on the previous night, and which presented
no check to the advance, and the march of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> from the
same Field, by Quatre Bras and Genappe, as far as La Belle Alliance,
in front of the Waterloo position, a distance of about sixteen or
seventeen miles; and this, too, in rear of a victorious Army, with a
Cavalry Rear Guard boldly and successfully impeding the advance of
its pursuers. It must, however, be taken into account, that in one
most important respect <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> possessed a decided advantage
over <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>&mdash;an advantage, the magnitude of which increased
with every moment that elapsed after the wet weather had set in; for
while the former moved the whole distance along a paved high road, the
latter had to proceed entirely by cross roads, which may more properly
be designated common field roads. It is to this particular point that
both <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> and <span class="smcap">Gérard</span> refer in justification
of the late arrival of the Infantry at Gembloux. Nevertheless,
<span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> detached considerably to his Right, with his Cavalry,
misled by the same idea which had prevailed with <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>,
that <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> had retreated upon the Meuse; and the very
circumstance of his Dragoons having reached Perwès on the night of the
17th, proves that had he organised a more extended, more combined, and
more energetic reconnaissance, with the sixty five Squadrons of Cavalry
which had been placed under his orders, he might have connected his
operations on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span> the right of the Dyle with those of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>
on the left of that river, by occupying the line of Nil St Vincent,
Corbaix, Mont St Guibert, and the Bridge of Moustier. The only check he
would have experienced would have been at the Prussian Post of Mont St
Guibert; which, however, in the case of an active reconnaissance, as
above, might have been attacked by a strong Detachment in front, and
turned by Corbaix on its left.</p>

<p>To show the connection which this disposition would have secured with
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s movements, it is only necessary to state, that
the Third Cavalry Division, under Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">Domon</span>,
had been detached from the Emperor's Column to reconnoitre the
country between the Dyle and the high road to Brussels; and that the
4th Regiment of <i>Chasseurs à Cheval</i> pushed as far as the Bridge of
Moustier, on which line its Skirmishers exchanged a few carabine shots
with some Prussian Dragoons, who did not, however, appear willing to
engage further with them. It was by means of this reconnaissance that
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> ascertained the retreat, through Tilly and Gentinnes,
of the principal Prussian Column, consisting of <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s
and <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s Corps, although the line by which they retired
was undiscovered by <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>, in whose immediate sphere of
operations it was situated.</p>

<p>But if such good grounds exist for inferring that, on the 17th, an
earlier and a clearer insight into the Enemy's movements might have
been obtained by the Corps detached in pursuit of the Prussians, and
that when obtained, it would have rendered the communication with the
operations of the main Army on the left of the Dyle, a matter not
only important in the highest degree, but also perfectly practicable;
and if a failure in this respect be attributable to the absence of
sufficient energy and vigour on the part of <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span> much
more forcibly does it not expose the extraordinary, the unaccountable,
dilatoriness of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> himself during the whole of the
precious morning of the 17th! How striking a view it unfolds of what
might have been accomplished, had the bivouac at Ligny been broken
up a few hours earlier! Then, <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Army was still
between Quatre Bras and the narrow Defile of Genappe, open to an attack
in front by <span class="smcap">Ney</span>, simultaneously with one in flank by the
force collected at Marbais (a part of which might have been detached
across the Genappe, towards the rear of the Anglo-Allied Army, by
Villers la Ville and Bousseval, masked by the Wood of Berme); and the
rearmost Corps of the Prussian Army (<span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s), which was
retreating through Gembloux, might have been attacked with effect, by
the superior force of all Arms under <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>.</p>

<p>As regards <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s movements during the early part
of the 18th, it is very remarkable, that although he had in his
despatch, written at ten o'clock the previous night, communicated to
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> his surmises of an intended junction of a portion
of <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s forces with those of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, and
his consequent intention of following the Prussians in the direction
of Wavre, <i>afin qu'ils ne puissent pas gagner Bruxelles, et de les
séparer de <span class="smcap">Wellington</span></i>, and although he must or ought
to have been aware that Wavre was only twelve miles distant from
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s main line of operations, whereas Gembloux was about
fifteen miles distant from Wavre, he not only delayed his departure
from Gembloux until between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, but
man&oelig;uvred by his right; taking the more circuitous line, through
Sart à Wallain, and rendering his operations still more dilatory by
moving both <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>'s and <span class="smcap">Gerard</span>'s Corps along one
and the same road. Had he not, from want of sufficient vigilance,
continued ignorant of the fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span> that the principal Prussian Column,
consisting of the First and Second Corps, had retired upon Wavre, at
so short a distance from his left as by the line of Tilly, Gentinnes,
and Mont St Guibert, there can be very little doubt that he would
have marched upon the latter point, which the Prussians, aware of its
importance, had occupied with a Rear Guard; but even with the amount
of information which he possessed, and with the inference justly
impressed upon his mind that a co-operation between <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>
and <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> was projected, we are at a loss to account for
his not having moved upon Mont St Guibert, and man&oelig;uvred by his left.</p>

<p>In his despatch, written at two o'clock in the morning, he mentioned to
the Emperor his design of marching upon Corbaix or Wavre; a movement
of which <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, in his reply, expressed his approval; and
if he had directed one of his Infantry Corps along the line of Corbaix
and La Baraque, and the other by that of Mont St Guibert and Moustier,
there can be no doubt that, even late as was the hour at which he
started from Gembloux, he would, in a great measure, have fulfilled the
expectations of his Imperial Master. In this case, he would naturally
have so divided his Cavalry, that one portion would have scoured the
country along the Front and Right of the Column marching by Corbaix and
La Baraque, and the other portion would have been employed in a similar
manner along the Front and Left of the Column moving upon Mont St
Guibert and Moustier. Both at this point and at Ottignies, about eight
hundred yards lower down the stream, there is a stone bridge across
the Dyle. There is a direct road from Moustier to St Lambert, scarcely
five miles distant, and another to the Field of Waterloo. The Cavalry
in advance of the Left Column could not have failed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span> discover the
Prussian troops in march to join the Left of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>; for
they were then passing slowly, and with extreme difficulty, through the
Defiles of St Lambert and Lasne. This discovery would have led to the
Right Column being moved by its left, from La Baraque to Moustier; the
Cavalry attached to it masking the movement as long as possible. The
Left Column would then, in all probability, have followed its advanced
Cavalry to St Lambert; and the Right Corps have either moved upon
the same point as a reinforcement, or have diverged upon Lasne as a
Support, upon which the former might have fallen back, if compelled to
effect its retreat towards Planchenoit.</p>

<p>In this manner might <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> have so far realised the
anxious expectation of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> as to have fallen upon
<span class="smcap">Bülow</span> <i>flagrante delicto</i>, and have materially procrastinated
the co-operation of <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> with <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> on the
18th of June; a co-operation which a contrary proceeding, originating
in fatal tardiness of movement, and exhibiting useless man&oelig;uvring
in a false direction, could not fail to render easy in execution and
successful in result. But beyond such procrastination of the meditated
junction of <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s and <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s forces,
<span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> could have effected nothing. The junction itself could
not have been prevented. The tendency of <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s movements
had been too narrowly watched; the country between the Dyle and the
Charleroi road to Brussels had been too vigilantly explored; and the
movements, in succession, of the different Prussian Corps had been
too nicely calculated and determined; to admit of the possibility of
a failure, as regarded the arrival of a considerable portion of the
Prussian forces on the Left of the Anglo-Allied Army.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blücher</span> had made so admirable a disposition of his four <i>Corps
d'Armée</i>, that two of them could at any time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span> have combined, and
therefore have presented a superior force to <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>, at any
point between Wavre and Planchenoit; whilst the remainder of the Army
might have continued its march to the Field of Waterloo. Had Grouchy
moved by St Guibert and Moustier upon St Lambert, <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s
Corps would then have been on the march towards Couture, according to
his original instructions; and finding <span class="smcap">Bülow</span> engaged with
the Enemy, would have joined him. <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> might then have
contrived to hold both these Corps at bay, and thus have reduced
the co-operating Prussian force at Waterloo to the two Corps under
<span class="smcap">Zieten</span> and <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>, besides considerably retarding
that co-operation; since without having experienced the effects of any
such interruption to the progress of the other Corps, as we have here
supposed, these two Generals did not reach the Field of Battle until
seven o'clock in the evening of the 18th.</p>

<p>Such is the extent of the advantage which, under the circumstances,
<span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> would have gained by a march from Gembloux upon
St Lambert; a most important one, no doubt, as time for pushing
the struggle with <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, with the whole force at his
immediate disposal, before the arrival of the Prussians, was of the
most vital consequence to <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>; and this advantage
<span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> entirely lost by his march upon Wavre&mdash;a march which
enabled <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> to appear with three, out of his four, <i>Corps
d'Armée</i>, on the great and decisive Field of Action; and that in
sufficient time to render the victory as complete as could reasonably
be desired.</p>

<p>No exertions, however, on the part of <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>, after he broke
up from Gembloux on the morning of the 18th, could have effectually
frustrated the junction of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> and <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>.
Two great errors, for which that Marshal was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span> not accountable, reduced
the contemplated junction from a measure of calculation to one of
certainty. The first and principal of these has already been adverted
to at some length, and cannot be too closely kept in view&mdash;the fatal
neglect of a vigorous pursuit of the defeated Prussians, on the night
of the 16th and morning of the 17th, by a detached Corps; combined
with the extraordinary delay in the attack upon <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> at
Quatre Bras, on the latter day. The second error arose from the want of
a strong reconnaissance and vigilant look out on the right of the main
French Army, on the morning of the 18th, followed up by the occupation
of the Defiles of the Lasne.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was nearly four o'clock when <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>'s Corps arrived
in front of the position which <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span> was in the act
of quitting, with a view to follow and support the remaining three
Prussian Corps that were at that moment on the march towards the
Field of Waterloo; and, with a fire that was opened from the French
Batteries, commenced the Battle of Wavre, which will be described in
its proper place in a subsequent Chapter.</p>

<p class="ph2"><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></p>


<p class="drop">IT rained incessantly during the night of the 17th, occasionally in
torrents; whilst loud and frequent peals of thunder fell ominously
on the ear of the toil-worn soldier, startling him from the fitful
slumber, which was all the rest the chill and comfortless bivouac on
the Field of Waterloo could afford him in that tempestuous night.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the morning dawned when the numerous groups, stretched
around the smouldering remains of the bivouac fires, or couched in
the hollows, or lying under such slender cover as the few trees and
brushwood within range of the positions of their respective Regiments
afforded, were seen gradually in motion; and as the eye of an observer
wandered along the space which lay between the main bodies of the
hostile Armies&mdash;a space varying in no greater width than from one
thousand to fifteen hundred yards&mdash;the Officers in command of the
several Picquets might be seen, on either side, withdrawing their
Vedettes and Sentries from the very limited and almost conversational
distance that had separated them from their opponents during the night,
concentrating their Detachments, and establishing their Main Posts more
within the immediate range of the respective positions occupied by the
grand Armies.</p>

<p>As the morning advanced, the dense vapoury masses which had so long
rolled slowly and heavily over the plain, gradually began, as if
relieved by the constant discharge of their contents, to soar into
a higher region, where, during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span> the whole day, with little or but
imperceptible motion, they hung spread out into a broad expansive
vault, through which the rays of the sun were unable fully to
penetrate, until just at the moment of its sinking from the scene of
strife, when it shed the full blaze of its setting splendour upon the
victorious advance of the Anglo-Allied Army. The drying and cleaning of
firearms soon became general, and the continuous discharge of muskets,
at rapid and irregular intervals, fell upon the ear like the rattle of
a brisk and widely extended skirmish.</p>

<p>All at once, the scene became more animated and exciting. Drums,
bugles, and trumpets were heard over the whole Field, sounding the
"Assembly"; and never was the call to arms, in either Army, responded
to with greater zeal, alacrity, and cheerfulness. While the Regimental
inspections, tellings off, and preparatory arrangements of detail were
proceeding, Staff Officers were seen galloping in various directions;
and, shortly afterwards, the different Brigades, which, by their
bivouacs had but faintly and irregularly traced the Line of Battle
taken up by each Army, were moved and distributed in the precise order
prescribed by the illustrious Chiefs who had on that day, and for the
first and only time, met to measure swords.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Field of Waterloo is intersected by two high roads (<i>chaussées</i>)
conspicuous by their great width and uniformity, as also by the
pavement which runs along the centre of each. These two roads, the
eastern one leading from Charleroi and Genappe, and the western from
Nivelles, form a junction at the Village of Mont St Jean, whence their
continuance, in one main road, is directed upon the capital of Belgium.</p>

<p>In front of the above junction; and offering, as it were, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span> natural
military position for the defence of this approach to Brussels, a
gentle elevated ridge of ground is intersected, at right angles, by
the Charleroi road, about 250 yards north of the Farm called La Haye
Sainte, and follows a westerly direction until about midway between the
two high roads: whence it takes a south-westerly course, and terminates
abruptly at its point of intersection with the Nivelles road, about
450 yards north of Hougomont, a Country Seat, with Farm, Offices,
Gardens, Orchards, and Wood. On the east side, the ridge extends itself
perpendicularly from the Charleroi road until it reaches a point,
distant about seven hundred yards, where, elevating itself into a Mound
or Knoll, it overlooks the Hamlet of Papelotte; and thence, taking a
north-easterly course, expands into an open plateau.</p>

<p>This ridge constituted the position of the First Line of the Duke of
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Army, which Line is more distinctly defined by
a road, entering on the east side, from Wavre, by Ohain, and winding
along the summit of the ridge until it joins the Charleroi high road
just above La Haye Sainte; from which point of junction a cross road
proceeds along the remaining portion of the ridge, and thus connects
the two high roads with each other.</p>

<p>The undulations of the ground in rear of this position were admirably
adapted to the disposition of the Second Line and Reserves, presenting
a gently inclined reverse slope along nearly the whole extent of the
ridge, with fine open and convenient stations for Cavalry, perfectly
concealed from the Enemy's observation.</p>

<p>The Right of the main position is bounded by a valley, which has its
source very considerably in rear of the Centre of the French position,
by which it is intersected; and thence, sweeping round the southern
and western inclosures of Hougomont, proceeds in the direction of
Merbe Braine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span> Into this valley a ravine directs its course in rear
of, and parallel with, the principal portion of the Right Wing of the
Anglo-Allied position, at a distance from the latter varying from 200
to 250 yards; and between this ravine, which is intersected by the
Nivelles road, and Merbe Braine, rises a sort of plateau, upon which
was posted a portion of the Second Corps, commanded by Lieutenant
General Lord <span class="smcap">Hill</span>, destined to act, as circumstances might
require, either in reserve to the First Line, or <i>en potence</i> to it in
repelling any attack upon that Flank of the Anglo-Allied Army.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Upon the extreme Left of the First or main Line was stationed
<span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s Light Cavalry Brigade, comprising the 10th and
18th Hussars, and the 1st Hussars of the King's German Legion. The
two former Regiments were in Line, in rear of the Wavre road, and
withdrawn a little from the crest of the ridge: the Right of the 10th
resting upon a lane, which, leading up from Smohain, crossing over
the position, and descending along its reverse slope, proceeds in the
direction of the Village of Verd Cocou. The 1st Hussars of the King's
German Legion were also in Line, and formed in reserve. The Left of the
Brigade was completely <i>en l'air</i>, upon high, open, and flat ground;
the main ridge widening considerably in that direction, as previously
explained. A Picquet, consisting of a Squadron of the 10th Hussars
(under Captain <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>), occupied the Village of Smohain, down
in the valley which, having its source a little to the westward of La
Haye Sainte, takes an easterly and therefore parallel course with that
part of the ridge which formed the Left Wing of the British position.
The Advanced Post of this Picquet was on the further side of the
Village, and its Vedettes formed a chain on the rising ground beyond,
within half-carbine shot of some French Cavalry, standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span> dismounted
in Close Columns. A party was detached from the Picquet as a Patrol on
the road to Ohain.</p>

<p class="caption">Battle of Waterloo at &frac34; past 11 o'clock a.m.
</p>

<p>The Village of Smohain, as also the Farms of La Haye and Papelotte,
with adjacent houses and inclosures, were occupied by a portion of
the Second Brigade of <span class="smcap">Perponcher</span>'s Division of the troops
of the Netherlands. The Regiment of Orange Nassau, consisting of two
Battalions, held Smohain and La Haye: while the Farm of Papelotte was
occupied by the Light Company of the 3rd Battalion of the 2nd Regiment
of Nassau, which, together with the 2nd Battalion of this Regiment,
and four guns of Captain <span class="smcap">Byleveld</span>'s Dutch-Belgian Battery of
Horse Artillery, were posted upon the exterior slope, immediately under
the brow of the main ridge, and a little to the westward of the lane
leading directly up the slope from the Farm of Papelotte.</p>

<p>The Advanced Posts of these troops were at the foot, and their Line of
Sentries extended along the brow, of the opposite slope of the valley;
this Line receded towards the western limit of the Hamlet of Papelotte,
where it joined the general Line of Picquets along the bottom of the
exterior slope of the position of the Anglo-Allied Left Wing.</p>

<p>On the right of <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s Brigade, and having its own Right
resting upon a narrow lane, forming a slight hollow way, lined with
hedges, stood <span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span>'s Brigade of Light Cavalry, consisting
of the 11th, 12th, and 16th British Light Dragoons, in Columns of
Squadrons, by Regiments, Left in front. The lane on which its Right
rested descending the interior slope of the position, joined the other
lane which led from <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s Right to Verd Cocou.</p>

<p>The extreme Left of the Infantry of the main Line of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span> position was
formed by the Fifth Hanoverian Brigade, under Colonel <span class="smcap">Vincke</span>,
belonging to <span class="smcap">Picton</span>'s Division. It was formed in Columns
of Battalions, those of Hameln and Hildesheim (under Majors
<span class="smcap">Strube</span> and <span class="smcap">Rheden</span>) in First, and those of Peine and
Gifhorn (under Major Count <span class="smcap">Ludolph von Westphalen</span>, and Major
<span class="smcap">Hammerstein</span>) in Second, Line; and was posted somewhat under
the crest of the ridge, upon the reverse slope, and in rear of the
junction of a lane leading up from Papelotte, with the Wavre road.</p>

<p>On the immediate right of <span class="smcap">Vincke</span>'s Brigade, and having its own
Right upon the Knoll which presents the highest and most commanding
point along the position of the Left Wing of the Anglo-Allied Army,
the Fourth Hanoverian Brigade, under Colonel <span class="smcap">Best</span>, was
drawn up. It formed part of the Sixth Division, and was composed of
the Landwehr Battalions of Lüneburg, Verden, and Osterode, which
were deployed in Front Line; and of Münden, which was in reserve. A
Battery of Hanoverian Foot Artillery, under Captain <span class="smcap">Rettberg</span>,
was attached to this Brigade, and, from the peculiarly favourable
circumstances of the ground, which formed a sort of natural fieldwork,
was most advantageously placed.</p>

<p>Upon the exterior slope of that portion of the ridge which lies
between the before mentioned Knoll and the Genappe high road,
<span class="smcap">Bylandt</span>'s Brigade of <span class="smcap">Perponcher</span>'s Division of the
troops of the Netherlands was deployed in Front Line. It consisted of
the 27th Battalion of Dutch Light Infantry, the 7th Battalion of the
Belgian Line, and of the 5th, 7th, and 8th Battalions of Dutch Militia.
Of the above, the 5th Battalion of Dutch Militia was posted in reserve,
along with the remaining four guns of Captain <span class="smcap">Byleveld</span>'s
Battery of Horse Artillery attached to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span> Brigade, in rear of the
straggling hedge which lines the Wavre road, between the Knoll and the
Charleroi high road.</p>

<p>Upon the interior slope of the ridge, and at a distance of about two
hundred yards from the Wavre road, was posted the Ninth Brigade of
British Infantry, under Major General Sir <span class="smcap">Denis Pack</span>, in a
Line of Battalion Columns, at deploying intervals. It consisted of
the 3rd Battalion 1st Royal Regiment, the 1st Battalion 42nd Royal
Highlanders, 2nd Battalion 44th Regiment, and of the 92nd Highlanders.
The Left Regiment, the 44th, was stationed on the Knoll, in rear of the
Right of <span class="smcap">Best</span>'s Hanoverian Brigade; and on the right of the
44th stood, in succession, the 92nd, 42nd, and 1st Royals.</p>

<p>Upon the right, but more in advance, of <span class="smcap">Pack</span>'s Brigade, and at
a short distance in rear of the hedge along the Wavre road, stood the
Eighth Brigade of British Infantry, under Major General Sir <span class="smcap">James
Kempt</span>, also in Line of Battalion Columns, at deploying intervals,
and comprising the 28th Regiment, the 32nd Regiment, the 1st Battalion
79th Highlanders, and the 1st Battalion 95th Rifles. The Right of the
32nd Regiment rested upon a high bank of the Charleroi road; on its
left stood the 79th Highlanders, and the 28th formed the Left Regiment
of the Brigade.</p>

<p>In the immediate front of the Right of the Brigade, and at a distance
from the Wavre road of about 120 yards, there was a Knoll having on its
right a large Sand Pit, adjoining the Charleroi road; and partially
facing the small Garden in rear of La Haye Sainte. On the Allied side
of the Knoll was a single hedge, extending about 150 yards from the
Charleroi road in a direction parallel to the Wavre road. In the Sand
Pit were posted two Companies of the 1st Battalion 95th British Rifles;
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span> Knoll and hedge were occupied by another Company of the same
Regiment. These Advanced Companies had placed an <i>abatis</i> across the
high road, near that part of it which is joined by the hedgerow. The
remaining Companies lined a portion of the Wavre road, commencing from
the point of its intersection with the Charleroi road.</p>

<p>These two Brigades, namely, the Eighth and Ninth British, together with
the Fifth Hanoverian Brigade, constituted the Fifth Division, under
Lieutenant General Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Picton</span>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Along the continuation of the ridge on the right of the great Charleroi
road, the Third Division, commanded by Lieutenant General Sir
<span class="smcap">Charles Alten</span>, was disposed in the following order:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Second Brigade of the King's German Legion, commanded by Colonel
<span class="smcap">Ompteda</span>, which formed the Left of the Division, consisted of
the 1st and 2nd Light Battalions (under Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">von
dem Bussche</span>, and Major <span class="smcap">Baring</span>), and of the 5th and 8th
Line Battalions of the King's German Legion (under Lieutenant Colonels
<span class="smcap">Linsingen</span> and <span class="smcap">Schröder</span>).</p>

<p>The 1st Light Battalion was formed in Column of Companies at quarter
distance, Left in front. It stood a little in rear of the cross road
which unites the great Nivelles road with that of Charleroi, on which
last its Left Flank rested. To the right of this Column stood the
5th Line Battalion, formed in Column at quarter distance upon one of
its centre Companies. In rear of these two Columns, and fronting the
deploying interval between them, stood the 8th Line Battalion, in
Second Line, in Column of Companies, at quarter distance, upon one of
its centre Companies.</p>

<p>The 2nd Light Battalion, under the command of Major <span class="smcap">Baring</span>,
occupied the Farm of La Haye Sainte.</p>

<p>The buildings of this Farm are so disposed as to form three sides of a
square, the north side comprising the Farm House itself, with a portion
of the stabling; the west side the remainder of the stables and cow
houses; and the south side principally a large Barn: a brick wall,
extending along the great road, unites the north and south buildings,
and thus forms the fourth boundary of the large quadrangular farm yard.</p>

<p>On the south, or French, side of the Farm, and down in the valley,
which here separates the Allied and French positions, lies an Orchard,
about 240 yards long and 80 wide, having for its eastern boundary, the
great road, in direct prolongation of the wall which incloses the farm
yard on that side. This Orchard is inclosed within a hedgerow; as is
also a Kitchen Garden, on the north side of the Farm, excepting the
boundary of the latter along the road side, which is a continuation of
the eastern wall.</p>

<p>A large gate and a doorway, the former almost facing the east end of
the Barn, and the latter quite close to the east end of the dwelling
house, lead from the yard into the great road; another gate, at the
south end of the stabling which forms the western side, as also a large
door from the west end of the Great Barn, lead both into a small narrow
portion of the Orchard, whence there is an outlet into the open fields
on the right. From the front door of the dwelling house, which faces
the farm yard, there is a passage to the back or north side of the
house, whence a door opens into the Kitchen Garden.</p>

<p>Since daybreak, the little garrison, amounting to scarcely 400 men,
had been busily engaged in strengthening their Post to the fullest
extent of the means within their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span> reach, which, however, were extremely
limited. Among the difficulties which they had to overcome, it may
be remarked that, on the preceding evening, immediately after taking
possession of the Farm, the soldiers had broken up the Great Barn door,
on the west side, for firewood; and that, about the same period, the
Carpenters of the Regiment were detached to Hougomont, in compliance
with an Order received to that effect. Unfortunately, also, the mule
laden with the Regimental trenching tools had been lost the day before,
so that not even a hatchet was forthcoming. Loop holes were pierced
through the walls; and a barricade was thrown across the high road,
in prolongation of the south wall. The Battalion was composed of six
Companies, of which Major <span class="smcap">Baring</span> posted three in the Orchard,
two in the Buildings, and one in the Garden.</p>

<p>On the right of <span class="smcap">Ompteda</span>'s Brigade stood the First Hanoverian
Brigade, under Major General Count <span class="smcap">Kielmansegge</span>, consisting of
the Field Battalions of Bremen, Verden, Duke of York, Grubenhagen, and
Lüneburg. The last mentioned Battalion was formed in Column, at quarter
distance, upon one of its centre Companies; the head of the Column in
line with, and at a deploying interval from, that of the Right Column
of <span class="smcap">Ompteda</span>'s Brigade. Next, on the right, at the proper
interval for deployment, stood the two Battalions Verden and Bremen,
in Contiguous Columns of Companies, at quarter distance; the former
Right in front, the latter Left in front. The two Battalions York and
Grubenhagen were formed in Second Line, in rear of the centre of the
interval between the Battalions Lüneburg and Verden, in Contiguous
Columns of Companies, at quarter distance, York Right, and Grubenhagen
Left, in front.</p>

<p>On the right of <span class="smcap">Kielmansegge</span>'s Hanoverian Brigade, was posted
the Fifth British Brigade, commanded by Major<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span> General Sir Colin
<span class="smcap">Halkett</span>, and comprising the 2nd Battalion 30th, the 1st
Battalion 33rd, 2nd Battalion 69th, and 2nd Battalion 73rd, British
Regiments. Its position was more forward than that of the other portion
of <span class="smcap">Alten</span>'s Division, with which its front was in an oblique
direction, its right shoulders having been brought forward so as to
preserve the parallelism between the general Line and the crest of
the main ridge. The 2nd Battalions 73rd and 30th Regiments formed
Contiguous Columns of Companies, at quarter distance, the former
Right, the latter Left, in front; and at a deploying interval for two
Battalions from the head of the Column formed by the Bremen Battalion.
The other two Battalions of this Brigade, the 1st Battalion 33rd and
2nd Battalion 69th Regiments, were formed in Contiguous Columns of
Companies, at quarter distance, in Second Line, and in right rear of
the 73rd and 30th Regiments; the 33rd Right, and the 69th Left, in
front.</p>

<p>In rear of the centre of the interval between the Right of
<span class="smcap">Kielmansegge</span>'s, and the Left of <span class="smcap">Halkett</span>'s Brigade,
was posted, in Second Line, the 1st Battalion of the 1st Regiment of
Nassau, forming part of the Nassau Brigade, commanded by Major General
<span class="smcap">Kruse</span>. The Battalion was in Column on a central Company. The
remainder of this Brigade, consisting of the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of
the same Regiment, was formed in Contiguous Columns, in a Third Line,
as a Reserve.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the right of <span class="smcap">Halkett</span>'s Brigade, the First British Division,
commanded by Major General <span class="smcap">Cooke</span>, was posted. It consisted
of the First and Second Brigades of Guards, and was disposed in the
following manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>The First Brigade commanded by Major General <span class="smcap">Maitland</span>, and
comprising the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 1st<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span> Regiment of Foot
Guards, formed the Left Brigade of the Division. The 3rd Battalion
stood in Columns of Companies, at quarter distance, on the crest
of the ridge; and between it and the head of the Right Column of
<span class="smcap">Halkett</span>'s Brigade, there was a deploying interval for one
Battalion. The 2nd Battalion was placed in Right Rear of the 3rd, also
in Column of Companies, at quarter distance: it was on the reverse
slope, and immediately under the crest of the ridge.</p>

<p class="caption">
Hougomont

</p>

<p>The Second Brigade, comprising the 2nd Battalion of the 2nd or
Coldstream Regiment, and the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Regiment of
Foot Guards, and commanded by Major General Sir <span class="smcap">John Byng</span>,
was posted on the crest of the ridge, between the First Brigade and
the Nivelles road. The 2nd Battalion 3rd Foot Guards was on the left,
the 2nd Battalion of the Coldstream Guards on the right, and more in
advance on the brow of the hill; and the disposition was such, that the
four Battalions of the Division were placed <i>en échiquier</i>.</p>

<p>The Buildings of Hougomont, its Gardens and Orchards, were completely
overlooked from the commanding ground occupied by the Second Brigade,
which formed the Reserve to the troops therein posted, consisting
(including those in the Wood) of the four Light Companies of the
Division, the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of Nassau, a Company of
Hanoverian Field Riflemen, and a Detachment of a hundred men from the
Field Battalion Lüneburg of <span class="smcap">Kielmansegge</span>'s Brigade.</p>

<p>The principal dwelling house or Château of Hougomont was a substantial
brick building, of a square form. Adjoining its north-east angle was
the Farmer's House, the east end of which abutted on the Great Garden;
and in the angle between this house and the Château was a narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
tower, of the same height as the latter, to which its interior served
as a staircase. At the south-east corner of, and communicating with,
the Château stood a very neat little Chapel.</p>

<p>On the north, or British, side of the Château, was a spacious Farm
yard, bounded on the west by a large Barn and a Shed, and on the
east by Cow Houses and Stabling adjoining the Garden. There was a
continuation of the Stabling along the north side, and a gateway;
and near the centre of the yard there was a drawwell of which the
superstructure formed a dovecot.</p>

<p>On the south, or French, side of the Château, and inclosing the latter,
was the Court yard; of which a Barn on the west, the Gardener's House,
some Stables and other Offices on the south, and the Garden Wall on
the east, formed the boundaries. There was a communication between the
Court and the Farm yard, by means of a doorway in the small portion of
wall connecting the Château with the great Barn; and through the whole
length of the latter building there was also a carriage way leading
from the one Court into the other. A gateway, passing through a portion
of the Gardener's House, led out from the Court yard to the south, or
French, side; and from this gate a narrow road conducted across the
open space between the Buildings and the Wood, through which it took
its course in the same direction until it gained the fields beyond the
inclosures. There was also a pathway from this road, commencing at the
corner of the little Garden, and traversing the Wood in the direction
of the south-east angle of the general boundary of the inclosures,
whence it continued towards La Belle Alliance.</p>

<p>The approach to Hougomont from the Nivelles road was lined, nearly as
far as the Château, by fine tall elms: it conducted to the gate of
the Farm yard facing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span> the British Line; and, sweeping along the west
side, it led also to the South Gate of the Court yard. On the east side
of the Buildings was a large Garden, laid out with all the formality
which characterises the Flemish style. It was inclosed on the south
and east sides by a high brick wall, and on the north side, facing the
British Line, by a hedge. Adjoining the east side of the Garden, but
considerably wider and longer than the latter, was the Large Orchard,
and along the north side was the smaller Orchard&mdash;the latter bounded by
a hedge and hollow way, and the former inclosed within high and compact
hedges, partially lined by a ditch on the inner side. A prolongation of
the southern hedge of the Great Orchard formed the boundary of the Wood
facing the south Garden Wall, and in the narrow space between these two
boundaries was a row of apple trees, which, together with the hedge,
served to conceal, in a great measure, the Garden Wall from the view
of an Enemy, approaching through the Wood. There was a small Garden in
front of the Gardener's house, formed by the continuation of the south
Garden Wall until it met another wall issuing perpendicularly from the
South Gateway leading out of the Court yard. There were two inclosures
on the west side, of which one served as a Kitchen Garden.</p>

<p>The Wood extended in length, southwards, about 350 yards, and its
greatest width was about 280 yards. It was bounded on the west by
another Orchard; and on the east by two large inclosures, of which the
one nearest the Great Orchard was a grass field fenced with hedges, and
lined by a ditch on the inner side.</p>

<p>Although the site of the buildings of Hougomont was but slightly
elevated above the valley, which, as already remarked, winds along
the south and west inclosures, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span> was a gradual but uninterrupted
ascent of the ground from thence as far as the eastern portion of the
fence which divides the two inclosures, beyond the great Orchard; where
it attained a height not much inferior to that of either the French
or Allied Front Lines, between which it was centrically situated. On
the south, or French, side of that hedge, the ground inclined at first
gently, and then rapidly, into the valley; but on the west, throughout
the extent of the Wood, and on the north of the Allied side, across the
Great Orchard, the descent was everywhere very gradual.</p>

<p>Such was Hougomont&mdash;a decidedly important point in the Field of Battle,
from its prominent position in the immediate front of the Right of
the British line; and rendered ever memorable by the truly heroic and
successful stand maintained throughout the day by the troops allotted
for its defence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From the first moment of the occupation of this Post, measures were
concerted and adopted for strengthening the means of defence which
it presented. During the night, the Garden Walls were pierced with
numerous loopholes; and, in order to enable the men to fire down from
the tops of the Walls upon their assailants, platforms constructed out
of such materials as the place afforded were raised wherever the depth
of the wall on the inner side rendered such a measure desirable. In
many places, however, and especially on the eastern side, the ground
formed embankments against the wall, sufficiently elevated to obviate
the necessity of any additional aid for such purpose. The outer gates
were closed up, with the exception of the one from the Farm yard, which
faced the Anglo-Allied position, and which was left open in order to
facilitate the communication with the latter. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span> different flanking
fires which were offered by the relative situations of the Garden
Walls, and the fences of the Orchards, Woods, and other inclosures,
imparted to the Post a strength, of which, in the course of the action,
due advantage was taken. In short, every precaution was adopted which
the means at hand suggested for contributing to the security of the
place; and the preparations that were in progress indicated, on the
part of the troops stationed in this quarter, an intention to give the
Enemy a warm reception, and a resolution to maintain a vigorous defence.</p>

<p>When, on the previous evening, the Light Companies of the Division were
thrown into Hougomont, it was so arranged that those of the Second
Brigade, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Macdonell</span>,
should occupy the Buildings and the Gardens: and that those of the
First Brigade, under Lieutenant Colonel Lord <span class="smcap">Saltoun</span>, should
hold the Great Orchard and the Wood; in which latter the Hanoverians
and Nassauers were principally stationed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The abrupt termination of the ridge along which the Allied Front Line
was posted, at its point of junction with the Nivelles road, was in the
direct rear of the buildings of Hougomont.</p>

<p>On the other side of the road, this termination presented a sudden
and bold, though short, slope down into the long valley which, after
sweeping by Hougomont, proceeds in the direction of Merbe Braine. A
portion of the slope, including the summit, was covered with brushwood,
and its base was bounded by a horse path, partially lined with a
stunted hedge; forming, altogether, excellent cover for Light Infantry.
On the other side of the valley, the ground ascends, at first abruptly,
and then gradually, to the summit of that portion of the main ridge
upon which the Left of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span> the French Army rested; and from the point of
junction of the Avenue conducting to Hougomont with the great Nivelles
road, a narrow road leads directly up the opposite slope, and stretches
across the ridge or plateau in the direction of Braine l'Alleud.</p>

<p class="figcenter" ><img src="images/illus20.jpg" alt="cap" />
<a id="illus20" name="illus20"></a></p>
<p class="caption">Hill</p>

<p>Along a portion of this road, principally consisting of a hollow way,
were posted in advance, some Light Troops of the Anglo-Allied Army.
They formed a part of the Fourth Brigade of the Fourth Division (under
Colonel <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>), attached to the Second Corps, commanded by
Lieutenant General Lord <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. The Brigade consisted of the
3rd Battalion of the 14th British Regiment (under Lieutenant Colonel
<span class="smcap">Tidy</span>), of the 23rd Fusiliers (under Colonel Sir <span class="smcap">Henry
Ellis</span>), and of the 51st British Light Infantry (under Lieutenant
Colonel <span class="smcap">Rice</span>), which troops were disposed in the following
manner.</p>

<p>Along that portion of the Hougomont Avenue which is nearest to the
Nivelles road was extended the Light Company of the 23rd Regiment.
On its right was an <i>abatis</i>, which had been thrown across the great
road; and close upon the right of this artificial obstacle, a Company
of the 51st Regiment was posted. Four more Companies of this Regiment,
and the Light Company of the 14th, were extended along the hollow
way alluded to as stretching across the ridge, on the extreme Left
of the French position. The remainder of the 51st stood in Column of
Support, about two hundred yards in rear of the hollow way. The 23rd
Regiment was stationed on the left of the Nivelles road, on the reverse
slope, and immediately under the crest of the main ridge, in rear of
the Second Brigade of Guards. The 14th Regiment was posted in Column
on the southern descent from the plateau, on which was assembled the
Second British Division; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span> from the view which it possessed of the
ground occupied by the 51st, it was well placed as a Reserve to the
Light Infantry. In a ravine, descending from the immediate Right of the
Skirmishers of the Brigade down into the valley, was posted a Squadron
of the 15th British Hussars (under Captain <span class="smcap">Wodehouse</span>), from
which a Picquet was detached to the right of the <i>abatis</i>, as also an
intermediate one for keeping up the communication; and some Vedettes
were thrown out to the right, having in their front a continuation of
the ravine, possessing a more marked and distinct character.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The troops posted upon the plateau already described as situated on
the west of the Nivelles road and in front of the Village of Merbe
Braine, and which, together with Colonel <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>'s Brigade,
constituted the extreme Right of the Anglo-Allied Army, under the
command of Lord Hill, were available either as a Reserve to the main
Line of Battle, or as a defence against any hostile attempt upon the
Right Flank. They consisted of the main body of the Second Infantry
Division, commanded by Lieutenant General Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Clinton</span>.
This was composed of the Third British Light Brigade, under Major
General Sir <span class="smcap">Frederick Adam</span>; of the First Brigade of the
King's German Legion, under Colonel <span class="smcap">du Plat</span>; and of the Third
Hanoverian Brigade, under Colonel <span class="smcap">Halkett</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s Brigade, consisting of the 52nd Regiment (under
Colonel Sir <span class="smcap">John Colborne</span>), of the 71st Regiment (under
Colonel <span class="smcap">Reynell</span>), of the 2nd Battalion of the 95th Regiment
(under Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Norcott</span>), and two Companies of the
3rd Battalion of the latter Corps (under Lieutenant Colonel Ross),
was, previous to the commencement of the Battle, posted between
the Village of Merbe Braine and the Nivelles road, near where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
latter is intersected by the cross road leading to Braine l'Alleud:
but as soon as the first attack was made upon Hougomont (with which
the Battle opened), it was advanced beyond this cross road, and
stood, in Battalion Columns of Companies, at quarter distance, on
the plateau; whence it overlooked the Nivelles road, and had a full
view of that portion of the main Front Line to which the troops of
<span class="smcap">Clinton</span>'s Division formed a Reserve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Du Plat</span>'s Brigade of the King's German Legion, consisting of
the 1st Line Battalion (under Major <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>), of the 2nd
(under Major <span class="smcap">Müller</span>), of the 3rd (under Lieutenant Colonel
<span class="smcap">Wissell</span>), and of the 4th (under Major <span class="smcap">Reh</span>), stood in
Open Column, near the foot of the slope descending towards the Nivelles
road.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halkett</span>'s Brigade, consisting of the Landwehr Battalions
Bremervörde (under Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">von der Schulenburg</span>),
Salzgitter (under Major <span class="smcap">Hammerstein</span>), Osnabrück (under Major
Count <span class="smcap">Münster</span>), and Quackenbrück (under Major <span class="smcap">von dem
Bussche Hünefeld</span>), was posted in Contiguous Close Columns of
Battalions, on the north side of the plateau, near the village of Merbe
Braine.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Second general Line of the Anglo-Allied Army consisted entirely of
Cavalry, British and German. Posted partly on the reverse slope of the
main ridge, and partly in the hollows in rear, it was entirely screened
from the Enemy's observation. The Brigades were formed, for the most
part, by Regiments, in Close Columns of Squadrons, at deploying
intervals.</p>

<p>Commencing from the right, near to the Nivelles road, stood the Fifth
Brigade, under Major General Sir <span class="smcap">Colquhoun Grant</span>, consisting
of the 7th and 15th Hussars, and of the 13th Light Dragoons (under
Colonel <span class="smcap">Doherty</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>

<p>On the left of <span class="smcap">Grant</span>'s Brigade was posted the Third Brigade
under Major General Sir <span class="smcap">William Dörnberg</span>, consisting of
the 23rd Light Dragoons, and of the 1st and 2nd Light Dragoons
of the King's German Legion. The Cumberland Hanoverian Hussars
(under Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Hake</span>) were attached to, and
formed in rear of, this Brigade. They properly belonged to Colonel
<span class="smcap">Estorff</span>'s Hanoverian Cavalry Brigade: as did also the Prince
Regent's Hussars (under Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Ferdinand</span> Count
<span class="smcap">Kielmansegge</span>), and the Bremen and Verden Hussars (under
Colonel <span class="smcap">August von dem Bussche</span>); which Regiments were detached
with the force at Hal.</p>

<p>Still more to the left, and in rear of the Right of <span class="smcap">Alten</span>'s
Division, stood the 3rd Hussars of the King's German Legion, under
Colonel Sir <span class="smcap">Frederick von Arentsschildt</span>.</p>

<p>Immediately on the right of the Charleroi road, and in rear of
<span class="smcap">Alten</span>'s Division, the First or Household Brigade, under Major
General Lord <span class="smcap">Edward Somerset</span>, was drawn up. It comprised the
1st and 2nd Life Guards, the Royal Horse Guards (Blue), and the 1st
Dragoon Guards.</p>

<p>On the left of the Charleroi road, and in rear of <span class="smcap">Picton</span>'s
Division, stood the Second Brigade, under Major General Sir <span class="smcap">William
Ponsonby</span>; consisting of the 1st Dragoons (Royals), the 2nd
Dragoons (Scots Greys), and the 6th Dragoons (Inniskillings).</p>

<p>The Fourth and Sixth Brigades, under Major Generals Sir <span class="smcap">John
Vandeleur</span> and Sir <span class="smcap">Hussey Vivian</span>, were posted upon the
extreme Left of the main Line of the position, as previously explained.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Reserves consisted of the Dutch-Belgian Cavalry Division, under
Lieutenant General Baron <span class="smcap">Collaert</span>; of the Brunswick Corps,
comprising both Cavalry and Infantry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span> the command of which, since
the fall of the Duke, had devolved upon Colonel <span class="smcap">Olfermann</span>;
and of the Tenth British Brigade, under Major General Sir <span class="smcap">John
Lambert</span>. The latter formed part of the Sixth Division, commanded
by Lieutenant General the Hon. Sir <span class="smcap">Lowry Cole</span>; and had only
just reached the Field, after having performed forced marches from
Ghent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Collaert</span>'s Division was stationed in rear of the Centre,
and within the angle formed by the junction of the high roads
leading from Charleroi and Nivelles. It comprised the First Brigade,
commanded by Major General <span class="smcap">Trip</span>, and consisting of the
1st Dutch Carabiniers, the 2nd Belgian Carabiniers, and the 3rd
Dutch Carabiniers; the Second Brigade, commanded by Major General
<span class="smcap">Ghigny</span>, and consisting of the 4th Dutch Dragoons, and the 8th
Belgian Hussars; and the Third Brigade, commanded by Major General
<span class="smcap">van Merlen</span>, and consisting of the 5th Belgian Light Dragoons,
and the 6th Dutch Hussars.</p>

<p>The Brunswick Corps was posted between the northern portion of the
Village of Merbe Braine and the Nivelles road, on which its Left
rested; and comprised the following troops:&mdash;a Regiment of Hussars, a
Squadron of Lancers, the Advanced Guard Battalion (which was at this
time detached to the right of Merbe Braine); a Light Infantry Brigade,
under Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Buttlar</span>, consisting of the Guard
Battalion, and the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Light Battalions; and an Infantry
Brigade, under Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Specht</span>, consisting of the
1st, 2nd, and 3rd Line Battalions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lambert</span>'s Brigade was posted near the Farm of Mont St
Jean; and consisted of the 4th Regiment (under Lieutenant Colonel
<span class="smcap">Brooke</span>), of the 27th Regiment (under Major <span class="smcap">Hare</span>), and
of the 40th Regiment (under Major <span class="smcap">Heyland</span>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to afford greater security to the Right Flank of the
Anglo-Allied Army, and also to keep open the communication with
the detached forces near Hal, and at Tubize, namely, the Corps of
Prince <span class="smcap">Frederick</span> of Orange, and the Sixth British and
Sixth Hanoverian Brigades, under Lieutenant General Sir <span class="smcap">Charles
Colville</span>; it was deemed essential to occupy the small town of
Braine l'Alleud, about three quarters of a mile westward of Merbe
Braine: and whence a road leads to Tubize, which is distant between
eight and nine miles.</p>

<p>With this view, the Third Division of the Netherlands, commanded by
Lieutenant General Baron <span class="smcap">Chassé</span>, was placed under the orders
of General Lord <span class="smcap">Hill</span>; a part of whose Corps, as previously
explained, formed the extreme Right of the Anglo-Allied position.
The First Brigade, under Colonel <span class="smcap">Ditmers</span>, occupied the town
itself. It consisted of the 35th Battalion of Belgian Light Infantry,
the 2nd Battalion of the Dutch Line, and of the 4th, 6th, 17th, and
19th Battalions of Dutch Militia. The 17th Battalion, detached a little
to the left, kept up the communication with <span class="smcap">Clinton</span>'s British
Division. The Second Brigade, under Major General <span class="smcap">d'Aubremé</span>,
occupied a good position about half a mile in advance of Braine
l'Alleud, upon a height on which stood the Farm of Vieux Foriez.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was at a very early hour of the 18th, that Lieutenant Colonel
<span class="smcap">Torrens</span>, Deputy Quartermaster General, reached Braine
le Comte, and delivered to Sir <span class="smcap">Charles Colville</span> the
Order (see page 285), for his falling back upon Hal. That General
immediately put in motion his two Brigades. These consisted of the
Sixth British Brigade, under Major General <span class="smcap">Johnstone</span>, and
the Sixth Hanoverian Brigade, under Major General Sir <span class="smcap">James
Lyon</span>, accompanied by Major <span class="smcap">Brome</span>'s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span> British Foot
Battery. The remaining Brigade (the Fourth British, under Colonel
<span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>), as also the other Foot Battery, belonging to the
Fourth Division (Captain <span class="smcap">Rettberg</span>'s Hanoverian), were on
the Field of Waterloo. On reaching Tubize, <span class="smcap">Colville</span> fell in
with the Advance of Prince <span class="smcap">Frederick</span>'s Corps: and as that
was the point of junction with the road leading by Braine le Château
and Braine l'Alleud to the position in front of Waterloo; he halted
there, and despatched Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Woodford</span>, Assistant
Quartermaster General to the Division, to report his proceedings
to the Duke. His Grace expressed himself perfectly satisfied; and
desired Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Woodford</span> to remain upon the Field
of Waterloo, in order that he might be prepared to return to Sir
<span class="smcap">Charles Colville</span> with any instructions which circumstances
might induce the Duke to transmit to him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Artillery of the Anglo-Allied Army, commanded by Colonel Sir
<span class="smcap">George Wood</span>, was distributed in the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>On the extreme Left was a British Horse Battery<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> of six guns, under
Lieutenant Colonel Sir <span class="smcap">Robert Gardiner</span>, with <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s
Hussar Brigade. Upon the exterior slope of the main ridge, and above
the Hamlet of Papelotte, were four guns of Captain <span class="smcap">Byleveld</span>'s
Dutch-Belgian Horse Battery, attached to <span class="smcap">Perponcher</span>'s
Division. The remaining four guns of this Battery were on the crest of
the main ridge, in rear of that Division. On the highest point of the
position of the Left Wing, and in front of the Right of <span class="smcap">Best</span>'s
Hanoverian Brigade, was posted Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span> <span class="smcap">Rettberg</span>'s Hanoverian
Foot Battery of six guns. In front of <span class="smcap">Kempt</span>'s Brigade stood
Major <span class="smcap">Rogers</span>'s British Foot Battery of six guns. Major
<span class="smcap">Lloyd</span>'s British, and Captain <span class="smcap">Cleeves</span>'s King's
German, Foot Batteries, of six guns each, were with <span class="smcap">Alten</span>'s
Division. Major <span class="smcap">Kuhlmann</span>'s King's German Horse Battery,
and Captain <span class="smcap">Sandham</span>'s British Foot Battery, of six guns
each, were attached to <span class="smcap">Cooke</span>'s Division. All the above
Batteries were posted in Front Line; as was also Lieutenant Colonel
Sir <span class="smcap">Hew Ross</span>'s British Horse Battery (from the Reserve), of
six guns, which was posted on the height immediately in rear of La
Haye Sainte, and near the intersection of the Wavre road with the
Charleroi high road, in which latter two of its guns were stationed.
Major <span class="smcap">Sympher</span>'s King's German Horse Battery, and Captain
<span class="smcap">Bolton</span>'s British Foot Battery, of six guns each, were attached
to <span class="smcap">Clinton</span>'s Division.</p>

<p>The remaining Horse Batteries were with the Cavalry. They were
(exclusive of Lieutenant Colonel Sir <span class="smcap">Robert Gardiner</span>'s already
mentioned) Major <span class="smcap">Bull</span>'s of six howitzers; Lieutenant Colonel
<span class="smcap">Webber Smith</span>'s of six guns; Major <span class="smcap">Whinyates</span>'s of six
guns, and provided with rockets; Captain <span class="smcap">Mercer</span>'s of six guns;
and Major <span class="smcap">Ramsay</span>'s of six guns. Captain <span class="smcap">Petter</span>'s
Dutch-Belgian Horse Battery of eight guns, was attached to
<span class="smcap">Collaert</span>'s Cavalry Division. The Dutch-Belgian Horse Battery
under Captain <span class="smcap">van der Smissen</span>, and Foot Battery under Captain
<span class="smcap">Lux</span>, of eight guns each, were with <span class="smcap">Chassé</span>'s Division
at Braine l'Alleud. The Brunswick Horse Battery, under Captain
<span class="smcap">Heinemann</span>; and Foot Battery, under Major <span class="smcap">Moll</span>, of
eight guns each, were with the Brunswick Corps. The British Horse
Battery under Major <span class="smcap">Beane</span>, and Foot Battery under Captain
<span class="smcap">Sinclair</span> (belonging to the Sixth Division), as also the
Hanoverian Foot Battery under Captain <span class="smcap">Braun</span>, all three having
six guns each, were in reserve near Mont St Jean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole of the Batteries were engaged in the Front Line, more or
less, during the course of the Battle.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This disposition of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s forces, so completely in
accordance with the general features of the ground which he had
selected with consummate judgment as the Field on which he was prepared
to give battle to his imperial rival in the great art of war, was
admirably calculated for either offensive or defensive measures. The
opposite line of Heights, which the Enemy would naturally crown with
the main Line of his forces, was fully within the effectual range of
cannon shot; and no hostile movement could be made against any part
of the position, that would remain undiscovered within the range of
musketry. The formation of the ground in rear of the ridge, along
the brow of which his Front Line was posted, was such as effectually
to screen from the Enemy's observation any movements of the Supports
and Reserves, preparatory to either a contemplated attack, or to the
assembling of the necessary means of resistance at any threatened
point. In rear of the main Front Line the ground was practicable for
the movements of all Arms, the country was perfectly open, and the two
high roads added still further to the facility of communication between
the front and rear. The occupation of the Posts of Hougomont and La
Haye Sainte presented important advantages in aid alike of offensive
and defensive operations.</p>

<p>The Right Flank was rendered secure, not only by the position of
<span class="smcap">Clinton</span>'s Division, commanding the valley skirting the Village
of Merbe Braine, but also by the occupation of the Town of Braine
l'Alleud, whence <span class="smcap">Chassé</span>'s Division could co-operate so as to
render any attempt of the Enemy to turn that Flank a most hazardous
experiment.</p>

<p>Although the Left of the main Front Line rested upon an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span> open plain
or elevated plateau, and was therefore completely <i>en l'air</i>: yet
the Village of Smohain, the Farms of La Haye and Papelotte, together
with the scattered houses and numerous enclosures on the abrupt slope
descending into the valley in front, by being well garnished with
Infantry, offered the means of protracted resistance; while Cavalry was
at hand, on the high ground, to cover the latter if forced to retire,
and to frustrate the complete development of the Enemy's disposition
of attack. The latter description of force was also available in
maintaining a vigilant look out for any direct flank attack; which,
however, was the less to be apprehended in consequence of the
preconcerted Prussian co-operation in that quarter.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The position also afforded ample security for a retreat. The two
broad high roads uniting at a point in rear of the centre, greatly
facilitated the retirement of unbroken masses upon Mont St Jean; while
the Village itself, and the numerous buildings and inclosures which
lined the great road as far as the Forest of Soignies, presented the
ready means of securing the further retreat of those masses, which, it
may be assumed, would have constituted a main Central Column.</p>

<p>On the right, the Villages of Merbe Braine, Le Mesnil, and L'Estraye,
connected with Braine l'Alleud and with one another, as also with the
Forest, by several cross roads, and intersected by numerous inclosures,
were well calculated for the retirement of the extreme Right of the
Army, by the advantages which they afforded for covering such retreat
with Light Troops.</p>

<p>On the left, the ground was more open, but the distance between the
position and the Forest was infinitely less, the latter stretching
southward to the Village of Verd Cocou; and the troops retiring in
this direction, being much closer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span> to the high road, would have their
Right in a great measure protected by the well defended retreat of the
Central Column.</p>

<p>The Forest itself, consisting almost entirely of tall trees,
unaccompanied by underwood, was passable for all Arms; it was
intersected by numerous roads and lanes in every direction; and its
southern extremity, adjoining the high road, was thickly skirted with
houses and gardens, adding considerably to its capabilities for a
vigorous stand against the further advance of an Enemy.</p>

<p>The retrograde march of the detached forces from Tubize and Hal upon
Brussels, and their junction with the remainder of the Anglo-Allied
Army in the position of Uccle, between that capital and the Forest of
Soignies, will readily present itself to the minds of military men
studying the dispositions and movements to which a retreat would have
probably given rise; but this is a subject which, embracing as it
naturally would, the consequent operations of the Prussians, opens a
wide field for discussion, into which it is unnecessary to enter.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The general direction of the Front Line of the French Army was nearly
parallel with that of the Anglo-Allies. The high road from Charleroi
to Brussels, which intersected the Allied position near its Centre,
also passed through the Centre of the French line. The point of this
intersection was La Belle Alliance, a small Farm house and Inn; and the
distance from the one position to the other, taken along the high road
between these two points, was 1400 yards.</p>

<p>About two hundred yards in the French rear of this house is a summit,
the altitude of which exceeds, by about thirteen feet, that of any
point along the Anglo-Allied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span> position. A ridge issuing from it, and
extending in a north easterly direction towards Frischermont, formed
the position of the Right Wing of the Front Line of the French Army.</p>

<p>On the west side, a road leading from the summit, descends rather
rapidly as a hollow way down into and across the long valley that takes
its course towards Hougomont, then ascends until it reaches another
ridge, along which it winds round that Post, at a distance varying from
300 to about 440 yards, until it joins the Nivelles <i>chaussée</i>; and
that winding road indicates pretty nearly the ground occupied by the
Left Wing of the French Front Line.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Right Wing of this Line consisted of the First <i>Corps d'Armée</i>,
commanded by Lieutenant General Count <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>, comprising four
Divisions of Infantry, and one of Light Cavalry.</p>

<p>Its Left Division, which was the Second, commanded by Lieutenant
General Baron <span class="smcap">Donzelot</span>, rested its Left upon La Belle
Alliance. The First Brigade of this Division, under General Baron
<span class="smcap">Schmith</span>, consisted of the 13th Regiment of Light Infantry
and the 17th Regiment of the Line; the former comprising three,
and the latter, two, Battalions. The Second Brigade, under General
<span class="smcap">Aulard</span>, consisted of the 19th and 51st Regiments of the Line,
each comprising two Battalions. These Brigades were deployed in two
Lines, the second at a distance of sixty yards in rear of the first.</p>

<p>On the right of the Second Division was the First, commanded by
Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">Alix</span>. Its First Brigade, under General
Baron <span class="smcap">Quiot</span>, consisted of the 54th and 55th Regiments of the
Line, each comprising two Battalions. Its Second Brigade under General
Baron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span> <span class="smcap">Bourgeois</span>, consisted of the 28th and 105th Regiments of
the Line, each comprising two Battalions. The Brigades were deployed in
two Lines, the second at a distance of sixty yards in rear of the first.</p>

<p>On the right of the First Division stood the Third, commanded by
Lieutenant General Baron <span class="smcap">Marcognet</span>. Its First Brigade, under
General <span class="smcap">Noguès</span>, consisted of the 21st and 46th Regiments of
the Line; and its Second Brigade, under General <span class="smcap">Grenier</span>, of
the 25th and 45th Regiments of the Line; all four Regiments comprising
two Battalions each. These two Brigades were, in like manner, deployed
in two Lines, the second at a distance of sixty yards in rear of the
first.</p>

<p>On the right of the Third Division, nearest to the extremity of the
ridge, and immediately opposite the Farms of Papelotte and La Haye,
was posted the Fourth Division, commanded by Lieutenant General
Count <span class="smcap">Durutte</span>. Its First Brigade, under General Chevalier
<span class="smcap">Pegot</span>, consisted of the 8th and 29th Regiments of the Line;
and its Second Brigade, under General <span class="smcap">Brue</span>, of the 85th
and 95th Regiments of the Line; all four Regiments comprising two
Battalions each. These two Brigades were also deployed in two Lines,
the second at a distance of sixty yards in rear of the first.</p>

<p>The Cavalry attached to this Corps, which was the First Division,
commanded by Lieutenant General Baron <span class="smcap">Jaquinot</span>, was posted
in a valley on the right of the Infantry: having in its front the
Village of Smohain, which it held in observation, as also the Château
of Frischermont, on the right of the valley; at the same time throwing
out Patrols in the direction of Ohain. It was deployed in three
Lines. Its First Brigade, under General <span class="smcap">Bruno</span>, consisting of
the 3rd and 7th <i>Chasseurs</i>; and its Second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span> Brigade, under General
<span class="smcap">Gobrecht</span>, of the 3rd and 4th Lancers.</p>

<p>The Artillery attached to the Infantry Corps, consisting of five
Batteries of eight guns each (including a Reserve Battery of eight
twelve pounders), was ranged along the front of the different Divisions
respectively; and the Battery of Horse Artillery&mdash;six guns&mdash;attached to
the First Division of Cavalry, was posted on the right of the latter.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Left Wing of the Front Line of the French Army was formed by the
Second Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Count <span class="smcap">Reille</span>,
comprising three Divisions of Infantry and one of Light Cavalry.</p>

<p>Its Right Division, which was the Fifth, commanded by Lieutenant
General Baron <span class="smcap">Bachelu</span>, rested its Right upon La Belle
Alliance, and was ranged along the descent from thence down into the
valley, which, more westward, winds past Hougomont. The First Brigade
of this Division, under General <span class="smcap">Husson</span>, consisted of the 2nd
Regiment of Light Infantry and the 61st Regiment of the Line, the
former comprising two, and the latter, three, Battalions; and the
Second Brigade, under General Baron <span class="smcap">Campy</span>, of the 72nd and
108th Regiments of the Line, the former comprising two, and the latter,
three, Battalions. The Brigades were deployed in two Lines, the second
at a distance of sixty yards in rear of the first.</p>

<p>On the Left of the Fifth Division, and upon the Height facing the
southern boundary of Hougomont, stood the Ninth Division, commanded by
Lieutenant General Count <span class="smcap">Foy</span>. Its First Brigade, under General
Baron <span class="smcap">Gauthier</span>, consisted of the 92nd and 93rd Regiments of
the Line, comprising two Battalions each. Its Second Brigade, under
General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span> Baron <span class="smcap">Jamin</span>, consisted of the 4th Regiment of Light
Infantry, and of the 100th Regiment of the Line, each comprising three
Battalions. These two Brigades were, in like manner, deployed in two
Lines, the second at a distance of sixty yards in rear of the first.</p>

<p>On the left of the Ninth Division, and along the ridge of the western
boundary of Hougomont, stood the Sixth Division, commanded by Prince
<span class="smcap">Jerome Napoleon</span>. Its First Brigade, under General Baron
<span class="smcap">Bauduin</span>, consisted of the 1st Regiment of Light Infantry and
of the 3rd Regiment of the Line, the former comprising three, and
the latter two, Battalions. Its Second Brigade, under General Baron
<span class="smcap">Soye</span>, consisted of the 1st and 2nd Regiments of the Line,
comprising three Battalions each. These two Brigades were also deployed
in two Lines, the second at a distance of sixty yards in rear of the
first.</p>

<p>On the left of the Infantry, was posted the Light Cavalry attached to
the Corps, namely, the Second Cavalry Division, commanded by Lieutenant
General Baron <span class="smcap">Piré</span>. Its First Brigade, under General Baron
<span class="smcap">Hubera</span>, consisted of the 1st and 6th <i>Chasseurs</i>; and its
Second Brigade, under General <span class="smcap">Mathieu</span>, of the 5th and 6th
Lancers. It stood across the Nivelles high road, in three deployed
Lines, rather under the crest of the ridge, on its reverse slope; and
threw out Picquets in the direction of Braine l'Alleud, as also more to
its left, thus keeping up a vigilant look out around this Flank of the
Army.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Second general Line of the French Army was formed in the following
manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the Centre, close along the west side of the Charleroi high
road, stood the Sixth Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Count
<span class="smcap">Lobau</span>. Only two of its Divisions, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span> Nineteenth and
Twentieth, were present; the Twenty First was with the Army under
Marshal <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>. Each of the two Divisions formed a Close
Column of Battalions by Grand Divisions; the head of the Column of the
Nineteenth Division being distant about a hundred yards in rear of the
right of the Second Corps, and an interval of about two hundred yards
was preserved between the rear of the Nineteenth Division and the head
of the Column of the Twentieth Division.</p>

<p>The former was commanded by Lieutenant General Baron <span class="smcap">Simmer</span>;
and its First Brigade, under General Baron <span class="smcap">de Bellair</span>,
consisted of the 5th and 11th Regiments of the Line, the former
comprising two, the latter, three, Battalions. Its Second Brigade,
under General <span class="smcap">Simmer</span>, consisted of the 27th and 84th Regiments
of the Line, comprising two Battalions each.</p>

<p>The Twentieth Division was commanded by Lieutenant General Baron
<span class="smcap">Jeannin</span>: its First Brigade, under General <span class="smcap">Bony</span>,
consisted of the 5th Regiment of Light Infantry, and of the 10th
Regiment of the Line; and its Second Brigade, under General
<span class="smcap">Tromelin</span>, of the 107th Regiment of the Line; all three
Regiments comprising two Battalions each.</p>

<p>There were three Batteries of Foot Artillery, of eight guns each,
attached to the Divisions, including one of reserve; as also a Horse
Battery of six guns. They were posted on the Left Flank of the Corps.</p>

<p>On the right of these two Divisions of the Sixth Corps, and separated
from them by the high road only, were stationed the Third Light Cavalry
Division, commanded by Lieutenant General Baron <span class="smcap">Domon</span>, and the
Fifth Light Cavalry Division, commanded by Lieutenant General Baron
<span class="smcap">Subervie</span> (belonging to the First Cavalry Corps, commanded by
General Count <span class="smcap">Pajol</span>). They were formed in Close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span> Column of
Regiments by Squadrons. The First Brigade of the former, under General
Baron <span class="smcap">Dommanget</span>, consisted of the 4th and 9th <i>Chasseurs</i>;
and the Second Brigade, under General Baron Vinot, of the 12th
<i>Chasseurs</i>. The First Brigade of the Fifth Division, under General
Count <span class="smcap">Colbert</span>, consisted of the 1st and 2nd Lancers; and the
Second Brigade, under General <span class="smcap">Merlin</span>, of the 11th <i>Chasseurs</i>.</p>

<p>The two Batteries of Horse Artillery attached to these two Divisions,
comprising six guns each, were posted on the Right Flank of the Column.</p>

<p>The Right Wing of the Second French general Line was composed of
the Fourth Cavalry Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Count
<span class="smcap">Milhaud</span>, which was posted on a parallel ridge, in rear of the
two central Divisions of the First Infantry Corps, and distant from
them about two hundred yards. It was deployed in two Lines, the second
at a distance of sixty yards in rear of the first.</p>

<p>The Corps consisted of two Heavy Cavalry Divisions&mdash;the Thirteenth,
commanded by Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">Wathier St Alphonse</span>, and the
Fourteenth, under Lieutenant General Baron <span class="smcap">Delort</span>. The First
Brigade of the Thirteenth Division, under General <span class="smcap">Dubois</span>,
consisted of the 1st and 4th <i>Cuirassiers</i>; the Second, under
General Baron <span class="smcap">Travers</span>, of the 7th and 12th <i>Cuirassiers</i>.
The First Brigade of the Fourteenth Division, under General Baron
<span class="smcap">Farine</span>, consisted of the 5th and 10th <i>Cuirassiers</i>; and
the Second, under General Baron <span class="smcap">Vial</span>, of the 6th and 9th
<i>Cuirassiers</i>.</p>

<p>The two Batteries of Horse Artillery attached to this Corps, comprising
six guns each, were stationed, one in the Centre, and the other on the
Left Flank.</p>

<p>The Left Wing of the French Second general Line, composed of the Third
Cavalry Corps, commanded by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span> Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">Kellermann</span>
(Count <span class="smcap">de Valmy</span>), was posted about two hundred yards in rear
of the Centre of the Second Infantry Corps. It was deployed in two
Lines, the second at a distance of sixty yards in rear of the first.</p>

<p>The Corps consisted of two Heavy Cavalry Divisions: the Eleventh,
commanded by Lieutenant General Baron <span class="smcap">L'Heritier</span>; and the
Twelfth, under Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">Roussel d'Hurbal</span>. The First
Brigade of the Eleventh Division, under General Baron <span class="smcap">Picquet</span>,
consisted of the 2nd and 7th Dragoons; and the Second, under General
<span class="smcap">Gniton</span>, of the 8th and 11th <i>Cuirassiers</i>. The First Brigade
of the Twelfth Division, under General Baron <span class="smcap">Blancard</span>,
consisted of the 1st and 2nd Carabiniers; and the Second, of the 2nd
and 3rd <i>Cuirassiers</i>.</p>

<p>The two Batteries of Horse Artillery attached to this Corps, comprising
six guns each, were posted one upon each Flank.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Third general Line, forming the Grand Reserve of the whole Line
of Battle, and comprising the entire force of the Imperial Guards,
Cavalry and Infantry, under the command of Lieutenant General Count
<span class="smcap">Drouot</span>, was thus formed.</p>

<p>The Infantry of the Imperial Guard constituted the Centre of the
Reserve. It consisted of four Regiments of Grenadiers, four Regiments
of <i>Chasseurs</i>, two Regiments of <i>Tirailleurs</i>, and two Regiments of
<i>Voltigeurs</i>; each Regiment divided into two Battalions. The 1st and
2nd Regiments of Grenadiers, and the 1st and 2nd of <i>Chasseurs</i>, formed
the Old Guard, under Lieutenant General Count <span class="smcap">Friant</span>; the 3rd
and 4th Regiments of Grenadiers, and the 3rd and 4th of <i>Chasseurs</i>
formed the <i>Moyenne</i>, or Middle, Guard, under Lieutenant General Count
<span class="smcap">Morand</span>; the four Regiments of <i>Tirailleurs</i> and <i>Voltigeurs</i>
constituted the Young Guard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span> under Lieutenant General Count
<span class="smcap">Duhesme</span>. This force was posted somewhat in advance of the Farm
of Rossomme, in six Lines of four Battalions each, at a distance of
twenty yards from one another, and so disposed that the Charleroi high
road alone separated the two Right, from the two Left, Battalions of
each Line. To each description of the Infantry of the Imperial Guard;
the Old, the Middle, and the Young, Guard, two Batteries, of eight guns
each, were attached. These were stationed on either Flank; and the
Reserve Artillery of the Guard, consisting of twenty four guns, was
posted in rear of these Lines.</p>

<p>The Right Wing of the Third Line, or Reserve, consisted of the Light
Cavalry of the Imperial Guard, commanded by Lieutenant General
<span class="smcap">Lefèbvre Desnouettes</span>, namely, the <i>Chasseurs</i> and Lancers of
the Guard. It was posted at a distance of about two hundred yards in
rear of the Fourth Cavalry Corps and deployed in two Lines, the second
at a distance of sixty yards in rear of the first. The two Batteries of
Horse Artillery belonging to the Corps, comprising six guns each, were
posted in its centre.</p>

<p>The Left Wing of the Third Line, or Reserve, consisted of the Heavy
Cavalry of the Imperial Guard, commanded by Lieutenant General Count
<span class="smcap">Guyot</span>, namely, the Grenadiers and Dragoons of the Guard. It
was stationed in rear of the Third Cavalry Corps, and deployed in two
Lines, the second at a distance of sixty yards in rear of the first.
Its two Batteries of Horse Artillery, comprising six guns each, were
posted in the centre.</p>

<p>This admirable order of battle, at once grand, simple, and imposing,
and presenting to its skilful designer the most ample means of
sustaining, by an immediate and efficient support, any attack, from
whatever point he might wish to direct it, and of possessing everywhere
a respectable force at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span> hand to oppose any attack upon himself, from
whatever quarter it might be made, was no less remarkable for the
regularity and precision with which the several masses, constituting
thirteen distinct Columns, advanced to their destined stations, than
for the unusual degree of warlike pomp and high martial bearing with
which the Lines drew up in this mighty battle array. The movements
throughout were executed under the cheering and spirit stirring sounds
of bugles, drums, and trumpets, sending forth the long cherished
national military airs of the Republic and of the Empire. The weather
had cleared up a little, and to the Anglo-Allied Army, the crowning of
the opposite Heights by the French Lines, with all its accompanying
circumstances, presented a magnificent spectacle.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> has frequently been blamed for having thus consumed
some very precious time in a mere ostentatious display of his forces.
Public opinion, however, should not suffer itself to be too easily
influenced by the apparent justness of such censure, and it would
be ungenerous to the established renown of the French Leader not to
attach due weight to the following circumstances. In the account of the
Battle attributed to the Emperor's own dictation, one cause of delay in
commencing offensive operations is represented to have been the soft
and miry state of the ground after the excessive rain which had fallen
during the night; in consequence of which it was found impossible
to man&oelig;uvre the Artillery and the Cavalry, and it was considered
advisable to wait until the ground had, in some degree, resumed its
natural consistency. When, therefore, the man&oelig;uvring of these two
Arms was pronounced to be practicable, though attended with some
difficulty, which, however, it was added, would gradually disappear;
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span> employment of the interval in an orderly and a deliberate
formation of a well-defined order of battle, was a measure scarcely
questionable <i>at the moment</i>, however much the <i>subsequent</i> course of
events may have proved that it militated against the chances of success
on the part of the French.</p>

<p>The additional impulse which this imposing spectacle was calculated
to impart to the moral force of his troops, is also well worthy of
consideration. His soldiers, as they contemplated the extended double
Front Line of Infantry, disposed as if about to enfold the Enemy in
a deadly embrace, and the fluttering of gay lance flags on either
extremity, indicating that its Flanks were duly protected; as they
glanced at the Second general Line, a double one of Cavalry, superbly
mounted, and proudly mailed in glittering helmet and cuirass; and,
as they scanned the well disposed Reserves and serried Centre; their
reliance on their own strength and in the resources of their Leader
was unbounded, their anticipations of success were heightened, and
their eager longing for the contest was greatly augmented. And while
adverting to the grand spectacle in a moral point of view, it would be
well to consider whether it may not have also been designed to exert
a powerful influence on that portion of the Anglo-Allied forces with
which the Emperor was tampering, in the full expectation of seeing
them again range themselves under his victorious Eagles: but which
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, with judicious foresight and prompt address, broke
up as a united body, and distributed among his British troops; thus
securing himself against the possible enactment of a scene similar to
that which so powerfully contributed to <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s disaster on
the plains of Leipzig.</p>

<p>But supposing it to be admitted upon these grounds that the delay
of the attack, having once been determined, was judiciously and
advantageously employed, we ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span> also to consider whether the delay
itself may not have been superinduced by motives of far higher import.</p>

<p>Although the miry state of the ground has been put forward as the
ostensible cause, can we for a moment imagine that <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>
was the man to have allowed himself to be deterred by such an obstacle
from commencing the attack at an earlier hour; had he, at the moment,
been sufficiently acquainted with the actual state of things to foresee
that the delay, together with the possibility of a lengthened contest,
and of the approach of aid to the British General from the Prussian
side, tended to render his situation one of extreme peril?</p>

<p>May we not rather be justified in inferring, that his object was
to gain time for the due execution and successful development of
<span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s operations! The despatch which the Emperor had
received from <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>, dated Gembloux, 17th June, at 10
<span class="smcap">P.M.</span> (see page 300), clearly explained that General's
intentions, which were, that should the mass of the Prussian forces
retire upon Wavre, he would follow them in that direction, so as to
prevent them from either reaching Brussels or forming a junction with
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>; but that if, on the other hand, they should
fall back upon Perwès, he would advance towards that town in pursuit
of them. In the former case, <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s delay was likely
to facilitate the combined operation; because in order to prevent
the junction with <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> required
sufficient time to throw himself between the Prussians and the Emperor:
and, in the latter case, the delay would be immaterial, because then
the Prussian co-operation with <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> was not to be
apprehended; and the battle with the Anglo-Allied Army would have to be
fought by the Emperor, unsupported by <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>.</p>

<p>It may, perhaps, be argued that <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, by commencing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
his attack much earlier, would not have been under the necessity of
employing a considerable portion of his Reserve against the Prussians
in defence of his Right Flank, at a time when he so urgently needed
them for following up and strengthening his attacks upon the Duke of
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s line. There existed, however, no such striking
disparity, in point of numbers, between <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s forces,
and his own, as to warrant his throwing away a chance amounting,
according to the information he had already received, almost to a
certainty, of being enabled to bring his greatest mass to bear against
each Army separately: and which would doubtless have been the case as
regards the Anglo-Allied Army, had <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>, by the adoption of
more vigorous and energetic measures, man&oelig;uvred in such a manner as
to sufficiently impede the Prussian co-operation by posting one of his
Corps so as to command the Defiles of St Lambert and Lasne, and holding
the other in reserve, to be employed by either the Emperor or himself,
according to circumstances.</p>

<p>Whether <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> was really actuated by any such motives, must
remain a doubtful point. These remarks, however, are offered for the
consideration of those who censure him for his delay in commencing the
Battle of Waterloo.</p>

<p>The martial sounds already adverted to as having accompanied the march
of the French Columns into position, had scarcely been wafted towards
the Anglo-Allied Army, when mounted Officers were discerned galloping
along the opposite Heights, and taking up the necessary alignments;
and, presently, the simultaneous flashing of bayonets over dark masses,
on various points, and the roll of drums, now become more distinctly
audible, announced the arrival of the heads of the Columns destined to
constitute the Front Line. As this gradually developed itself, and was
seen extending on either side, from La Belle Alliance, and apparently
almost overlapping both Flanks of the Allies, the scene became truly
imposing and highly exciting. The two Armies were now fairly in
presence of each other; and their mutual observation was governed by
the most intense interest, and the most scrutinizing anxiety.</p>

<p>In a still greater degree did these feelings actuate their Commanders,
while watching each other's preparatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span> movements, and minutely
scanning the surface of the arena on which tactical skill, habitual
prowess, physical strength, and moral courage, were to decide, not
alone their own, but in all probability, the fate of Europe. Apart
from national interests and considerations, and viewed solely in
connection with the opposite characters of the two illustrious Chiefs;
the approaching contest was contemplated with anxious solicitude by
the whole military world. Need this create surprise when we reflect
that the struggle was one for mastery between the far famed Conqueror
of Italy, and the victorious Liberator of the Peninsula; between the
triumphant Vanquisher of Eastern Europe, and the bold and successful
Invader of the South of France! Never was the issue of a single Battle
looked forward to as involving consequences of such vast importance&mdash;of
such universal influence.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s report, despatched from
Gembloux on the previous night, was well calculated to inspire the
Emperor with great confidence as to the result of his present plan of
operations, notwithstanding the very little progress that had hitherto
been made in that quarter; and which, as already remarked, must be
ascribed principally to his own inactivity during the early part of the
17th. He approved of the movement upon Wavre, in pursuit of the great
mass of the Prussian Army: but at the same time expressed his desire
that it should be executed in such a manner as to draw the Detached
Force more within the sphere of the operations of the main French
Army; and above all, he enforced the necessity of maintaining a close
communication with the latter.</p>

<p>Some time before the Battle commenced, a Prussian Patrol reached the
Village of Smohain, in which was posted the Picquet of the 10th British
Hussars, under Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span> <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>; whom the Officer accompanying
the Patrol desired to report to the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> that
General Count <span class="smcap">Bülow</span> was at St Lambert, and advancing with
his <i>Corps d'Armée</i>. Captain <span class="smcap">Taylor</span> immediately despatched
Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Lindsey</span>, of the 10th, with the intelligence to Head
Quarters, as directed. The Prussian Officer was certainly ignorant of
the very slow progress made by the main body of <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Corps;
and the information which he thus conveyed to the Duke, before the
Battle had commenced, naturally led the latter to calculate upon a much
earlier arrival of the Prussians than could possibly take place: for,
in point of fact, it was only <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Advanced Guard which had
then reached St Lambert.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The formation of the French Lines was scarcely completed when the
magnificent and animating spectacle which they presented was heightened
in an extraordinary degree by the passing of the Emperor along them,
attended by a numerous and brilliant Staff. The troops hailed him
with loud and fervent acclamations. There was depicted on their brows
a deep rooted confidence in his ability, with such an Army, to chain
victory to the car in which he had already advanced in triumph to
within a few miles of the capital of Belgium. They exulted in the idea
that they were now fairly ranged in battle array, under the Chief of
their choice, and the idol of their devotion, against the Army of that
nation which of all others had proved the most inveterate and the most
enduring in its hostility to France; a nation which had not only by its
wealth cemented and held together the great European league which had
once precipitated that idol from the throne, but had also flung into
the scale her own native strength and valour, by which the Fleets of
the Empire had been destroyed, its Armies driven out of the Peninsula,
and the sceptres of Spain and Portugal wrested from its grasp.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span> They
appeared as if excited by the assurance, that the hour had arrived
in which the disasters of the Nile and Trafalgar, of Salamanca and
Vittoria, were to be cast into the dark shade of oblivion, by the
dazzling splendour of the triumph about to be achieved.</p>

<p>Never throughout the whole of his career had <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> received
from his soldiers more unequivocal demonstrations of attachment to his
person, of unlimited confidence in his power, of complete devotion
to his cause, and of absolute submission to his will, than were
manifested in this short and fatal Campaign by which that career was
terminated. With an Army thus animated by one sentiment, and presenting
in appearance and material all that his practised eye could desire,
it may readily be conceived that he fully participated in the general
confidence of a signal victory.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s dispositions remained as previously described.
Shortly before the action commenced, he rode down to Hougomont, and,
proceeding by the Lane which crosses the Wood in the direction of La
Belle Alliance, remained a few minutes at the point where the Lane
reaches the eastern boundary of the Wood. Having made his observations
upon that portion of the Enemy's Line which came under his view, he
ordered the Light Companies of the British Guards that were in the
Wood to be relieved by the Nassau Battalion and the Hanoverian Light
Infantry. The former were then withdrawn to the Great Orchard, where
the Light Companies of the First Brigade remained, while those of the
Second Brigade moved on, along the rear of the inclosures, to the Lane
which passes between the right of the Buildings and the Kitchen Garden,
and leads into the Wood on that side.</p>

<p>The Duke next rode up to the high ground on the Nivelles road,
unaccompanied by his Staff, to reconnoitre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span> the Enemy's Left. He then
rode along to the Left of his own Line as far as La Haye. When the
action began, he was in front of the Left of the First Brigade of
Guards.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, having completed the inspection of his troops,
proceeded to take up his own station upon the Height in rear of La
Belle Alliance, which afforded him a commanding view of the whole
Field. The Infantry Brigades speedily formed Lines of Battalion Columns
respectively. The state of the ground was reported practicable for the
movements of Artillery. All was in perfect readiness.</p>

<p>The anxiously looked for moment had now arrived.</p>

<p>The Emperor sent an Order to <span class="smcap">Reille</span> to begin the Battle by
an attack upon Hougomont; and it was about half past eleven o'clock
when, from the right of Prince <span class="smcap">Jerome</span>'s Division, a Column,
advancing towards the south-western boundary of the Wood, rapidly
extended itself into a strong line of Skirmishers. As they approached
the Wood, a few straggling shots from behind the outermost trees and
hedges gave warning that the defenders were prepared for resistance,
and announced to both Armies that the Battle had actually commenced.
The French, hastening their advance to obtain a better view of their
opponents, began to single them out; and the shots from both sides,
quickening in succession, speedily increased into a brisk and well
sustained fire of musketry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerome</span>'s supporting Columns had not advanced far when the
Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, with his Staff, galloped up to the spot
on which the Coldstream Guards were formed; and having directed his
glass upon the French Columns, the guns of Captain <span class="smcap">Sandham</span>'s
Foot Battery, attached to <span class="smcap">Cooke</span>'s Division, were ordered to
the front. They instantly unlimbered and opened the cannonade from
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span> Anglo-Allied position. The first discharge was from a howitzer,
the shell of which burst over the head of a Column moving towards the
Hougomont inclosures. The shots from the remaining guns in succession
also took effect; and the Battery was soon in full play. It was
immediately followed up by an equally well directed fire from Captain
<span class="smcap">Cleeves</span>'s Foot Battery of the German Legion, in front of
<span class="smcap">Alten</span>'s Division.</p>

<p>The Batteries of <span class="smcap">Reille</span>'s Corps now opened in their turn,
to draw off the fire from their Columns. <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> sent an
Order to <span class="smcap">Kellermann</span> to push forward his twelve pieces of
Horse Artillery into the Front Line, facing Hougomont. The intervals
between the reports from the guns on either side rapidly diminished:
in a brief space of time no intervals could be distinguished; and the
cannonade, increasing in violence every moment, now thundered forth in
one continual roar.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">
 "&mdash;&mdash;deep throated engines belch'd, whose roar<br />
Imbowel'd with outrageous noise the air."
</p>

<p>The French Columns, as they moved towards Hougomont, were twice
checked by the fire from the British Batteries; which, having been
given with remarkable precision, appeared to cause considerable loss
and disorder among them. At length they effected their advance. The
French Skirmishers, followed by fresh Supports, had, in the mean time,
made good their entrance into the Wood; and such was the boldness of
their advance that they soon drove the Nassau Battalion and Hanoverian
Riflemen before them. They were also pushing forward in considerable
force across the inclosures adjoining the left of the Wood.</p>

<p>At this moment, <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> gave Orders, in person, to Major
<span class="smcap">Bull</span>'s British Howitzer Horse Battery, which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span> just been
drawn up on that part of the main ridge which was immediately in rear
of the Great Orchard of Hougomont, to dislodge the Enemy's Infantry
from those inclosures by means of shells. This service, which,
considering the proximity of the Allied troops in the Wood, was of a
very delicate nature, was executed with admirable skill, and attended
with the desired effect. The Enemy was forced to abandon the fields
in front of the Great Orchard; from which the Light Companies of the
First Brigade of Guards now moved on, as did also those of the Second
Brigade, from the Lane and Kitchen Garden on the right, to relieve the
Nassauers and Hanoverians in the Wood. They dashed forward with the
most determined resolution, blazing away in the very faces of their
opponents, whose further advance they completely checked; and then
gallantly pressing on, they gradually succeeded in clearing the Wood of
the French Skirmishers.</p>

<p>With the exception of the cannonade maintained between the French Left
and the Anglo-Allied Right Wing, and which was gradually extending
towards the opposite extremities of the hostile Lines, the action was
as yet confined to the Post of Hougomont.</p>

<p>About this time, a body of French Cavalry, issuing from the low ground
near Papelotte, approached that part of the Anglo-Allied Left Wing
which was occupied by <span class="smcap">Best</span>'s Hanoverian Infantry Brigade, and
Captain <span class="smcap">Rettberg</span>'s Hanoverian Foot Battery. It was a strong
<i>reconnaissance</i>, made by the French to ascertain whether the summit
on which the above Battery was posted had really been intrenched,
its appearance, as viewed from the opposite Heights, having induced
a supposition that such was the case. <span class="smcap">Best</span>, expecting to be
attacked, immediately formed his Brigade into Battalion Squares; but
the French Cavalry speedily retired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerome</span> now moved down fresh Columns to reinforce his
Skirmishers. They were directed more against the Allied Right of the
Wood, while a part of <span class="smcap">Foy</span>'s Division was ordered to support
the attack by a simultaneous advance against the front. The descent
of <span class="smcap">Jerome</span>'s troops was observed from the position of the
extreme Right of the Allied Second Line, which afforded a partial
view up the valley on that side of Hougomont. Two guns were therefore
detached, under Captain <span class="smcap">Napier</span>, from Captain <span class="smcap">Bolton</span>'s
Battery, to open a fire upon the advancing Columns; but they were
instantly cannonaded by the Batteries on the French Extreme Left,
particularly by the Horse Battery of <span class="smcap">Piré</span>'s Light Cavalry,
on the Height intersected by the Nivelles road. The remaining guns
of the Battery were brought into action, as were also those of Major
<span class="smcap">Sympher</span>'s Hanoverian Horse Battery; and a vigorous fire was
now maintained against both the attacking troops and the French guns.
Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Webber Smith</span>, whose British Horse Battery
was also with <span class="smcap">Clinton</span>'s Division, but lower down the slope,
commenced firing up the valley, across the Nivelles road, at one of
<span class="smcap">Jerome</span>'s Columns; but on ascertaining that the latter was
somewhat beyond the effectual range of his six pounders, he detached
an Officer to the right of the Front Line in rear of Hougomont, to
discover whether a more commanding position could be obtained for his
Battery on that part of the Field.</p>

<p>In the mean time, <span class="smcap">Jerome</span>'s Skirmishers, having been very
strongly reinforced, renewed their attack upon the Wood, in conjunction
with <span class="smcap">Foy</span>'s Infantry on their right. The Light Companies of the
British Guards presented a stout and desperate resistance, but were
forced to yield to an overwhelming superiority of numbers. Retiring
from tree to tree, and frequently hazarding a bold and obstinate
stand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span> by which they suffered most severely, they at length withdrew
from the unavailing contest: those of the Coldstream and 3rd Regiment
seeking shelter partly in the Lane adjoining the right of the Château,
and partly behind a Haystack which fronted the Wood near the south-west
angle of the buildings; while those of the 1st Regiment fell back into
the Great Orchard, on the left.</p>

<p>The French Skirmishers, finding themselves relieved for the moment from
any immediate pressure upon their front, now rapidly advanced towards
the Buildings and Garden. The hedge which lined the Wood on this side
appeared to them, as it gradually presented itself to their view, to
form also the boundary of the Great Garden. In the full confidence that
this important post was now within their grasp, they rushed forward
at the <i>pas de charge</i> to force an entrance. They were instantly and
fatally undeceived. A deadly fire bursting forth from the loop holes
and platforms along the Garden Wall, which was parallel to, and about
thirty yards distant from, the hedge, laid prostrate the leading Files.
Those which came up in rapid succession were staggered by the sudden
and unexpected appearance of this little fortress. Not venturing upon
an escalade, they were forced to take advantage of such cover as was
afforded by the hedge and trees; whence they kept up a popping fire,
though at fearful odds, with opponents so well concealed by the wall,
as also by a row of apple trees which ran along its exterior.</p>

<p>The French Infantry were pushing forward through the Wood in support of
this attack, when Major <span class="smcap">Bull</span>'s Horse Battery recommenced its
fire; and a shower of howitzer shells fell amongst them, causing the
greatest destruction and confusion in their ranks.</p>

<p>Again the defenders dashed forward from the Flanks, and regained a
considerable portion of the Wood; whereupon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span> Major <span class="smcap">Bull</span>
ceased firing in that direction, and pointed his guns on strong
Columns of French Infantry in support, which he succeeded in causing
to retrograde; notwithstanding the very galling fire to which he was
himself at that time exposed, not only from the Batteries in his front,
but also from <span class="smcap">Piré</span>'s Horse Battery on the French Height
adjoining the Nivelles road, by which his own Battery was completely
enfiladed.</p>

<p>The French that were in the Wood having rallied, and obtained a vast
preponderance of force, now advanced in a most determined manner
against the Light Infantry of the British Guards, and compelled the
latter to retire to their former posts on the Flanks of the Château
and Gardens. At the same time, <span class="smcap">Jerome</span>'s Light Troops were
advancing rapidly, and in great force, against the right of the
Buildings. That portion of the Light Companies of the Coldstream and
3rd Regiment of Guards which was outside the Farm made a gallant stand,
under cover of the Haystack, and from the Lane before mentioned. The
Haystack itself was set on fire by the French in one of their attacks,
and was now in full blaze. These Guardsmen held their ground with the
greatest bravery until they saw themselves completely outflanked, and
in danger of being cut off from all retreat.</p>

<p>They then hastily withdrew into the great Court Yard by the Gate
which faces the Allied position; and which they instantly closed and
endeavoured to block up with ladders, posts, barrows, or whatever was
nearest at hand. The French, however, succeeded in forcing the Gate;
but the defenders betook themselves to the nearest cover, whence
they poured a fire upon the intruders, and then rushing forward, a
struggle ensued which was distinguished by the most intrepid courage
on both sides. At length, Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Macdonell</span>,
Captain <span class="smcap">Wyndham</span>, Ensigns <span class="smcap">Gooch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span></span> and <span class="smcap">Hervey</span>,
and Sergeant <span class="smcap">Graham</span>, of the Coldstream Guards, by dint of
great personal strength and exertions, combined with extraordinary
bravery and perseverance, succeeded in closing the Gate against their
assailants. Those of the latter who had entered the Court Yard fell a
sacrifice to their undaunted and conspicuous gallantry.</p>

<p>The remainder of the French Skirmishers, passing on by the Left and
to the Rear of Hougomont, and, crossing the Avenue leading to it
from the Nivelles road, and the adjacent rivulet, spread themselves
over some broken ground partially covered with brushwood. They were
now immediately under the position to which Lieutenant Colonel
<span class="smcap">Smith</span> had moved his Battery from its former station on the
other side of the Nivelles road, and which was in front of the Extreme
Right of the First Line of the Anglo-Allied Army. This Battery had just
been hotly engaged with, and had suffered severely from, the Horse
Battery posted in front of <span class="smcap">Piré</span>'s Light Cavalry Brigade; which
had previously directed its fire upon <span class="smcap">Bull</span>'s guns, and which
maintained the cannonade with Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Smith</span>'s
Battery for the purpose of covering the advance of these Light Troops.
<span class="smcap">Smith</span> had succeeded in silencing the fire of his opponent;
when the French Skirmishers, taking advantage of both the broken ground
and the high corn beyond it, suddenly opened upon his Battery a popping
fire so destructive in its effects, that in a few moments several of
the Gunners and horses were killed, and so much damage was sustained by
the limbers, that it became absolutely necessary to withdraw the guns
into a little hollow way that led from the rear of the Battery into the
Nivelles road, and in which it remained some time for the purpose of
refitting and getting into order.</p>

<p>This daring onset of the French Skirmishers was checked by the advance
of four Companies of the Coldstream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span> Regiment of Guards, under
Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Woodford</span>. They then fell back to the wall
of the Farm yard, near which they collected a considerable force, when
Colonel <span class="smcap">Woodford</span> charged them. They gave way immediately, and
withdrew from the contest; which afforded Colonel <span class="smcap">Woodford</span> an
opportunity of entering the Farm with a part of the reinforcement by
the side door in the Lane. The remainder of the detached force occupied
the inclosures between the Château and the Nivelles road.</p>

<p>During this advance of the French Skirmishers against the extreme
Right of the Allied Front Line, the troops which formed their
Support attempted again to force open the rear Gate of Hougomont.
The individuals before mentioned as having closed the Gate, were, at
the time, occupied in rendering it more secure by placing against it
some pieces of ash timber that lay in the yard. The French failing in
their endeavours to push in the Gate, a brave Grenadier volunteered
to climb over and open it from the inside. Captain <span class="smcap">Wyndham</span>,
on perceiving the latter at the top of the gate, instantly desired
Sergeant <span class="smcap">Graham</span>, whose musket he was holding whilst the
latter was bringing forward another piece of timber, to drop the wood,
take his firelock, and shoot the intruder. The Order was instantly
obeyed; and the intrepid assailant, who, for any useful result, ought
to have been accompanied by a score of his comrades, fell beneath
<span class="smcap">Graham</span>'s deadly aim. It was at this moment that the French
Skirmishers who had advanced against the main position, were falling
back upon their Support; and the whole of these troops were driven off
by the advance of the four Companies of the Coldstream Guards, detached
from the main position, as previously described.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the French Infantry in the Wood, finding their
advance against the Garden so suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span> checked, endeavoured to turn
it by its Left. With this view they were debouching through a large
gap in the fence, forming an outlet from the Wood into the Orchard;
when Lieutenant Colonel Lord <span class="smcap">Saltoun</span>, seizing the favourable
opportunity, made a most gallant charge upon the head of the Column
with the Light Companies of the First Brigade of Guards, and succeeded
in driving the Enemy back into the Wood.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, a large body of the Enemy's Light Troops began to
advance stealthily along the eastern hedge of the Hougomont inclosures,
communicating at the same time with the Infantry in the Wood on their
Left. This was immediately followed by a direct front attack upon the
Orchard; which compelled Lord <span class="smcap">Saltoun</span> gradually to withdraw
his greatly reduced force, from tree to tree, until he reached the
hollow way in rear of that inclosure.</p>

<p>The Light Troops in front of <span class="smcap">Alten</span>'s Division, having
perceived the French creeping along the hedge so as to turn the Left
Flank of Hougomont, were on the point of forming to oppose them; but
on the latter being pointed out to the Prince of <span class="smcap">Orange</span>,
who had just come to the front to make his observations, he coolly
remarked:&mdash;"No, don't stir&mdash;the Duke is sure to see that movement, and
will take some step to counteract it." He had scarcely spoken, when
two Companies of the 3rd Regiment of British Guards, detached from the
Allied Line, were seen advancing along the same hedge, in an opposite
direction, to meet them.</p>

<p>Lord <span class="smcap">Saltoun</span> being thus reinforced upon his Left, and the
French Skirmishers in his front having become exposed to a sharp
flanking fire from the Guards lining the eastern Garden Wall, he
resumed the offensive; cleared the Orchard of the Enemy, and reoccupied
its front hedge: while the Detachment on the Left drove the French
along the outer hedge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span> and down into the hollow whence they had
debouched; and then joined the troops in the Great Orchard. The front
Hedge of the Orchard, the front Wall of the Garden, with the Lane and
Avenue on the right, constituted at this time the Outer Line of the
defence of Hougomont.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>During the progress of the contest of Hougomont, <span class="smcap">Ney</span> had been
occupied in making his preparatory dispositions for carrying into
execution <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s intended grand attack upon the Centre and
Left of the Anglo-Allied line. The troops destined for this service
consisted of the whole of <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, and of
<span class="smcap">Roussel</span>'s Division of <span class="smcap">Kellermann</span>'s Cavalry Corps.
Their advance was to be covered and supported by no less than ten
Batteries, which were now brought forward and posted along a ridge that
intervened between the French Right and the Allied Left Wing, affording
the guns a range of from six hundred to eight hundred yards of the
Duke's Line. These Batteries consisted of the three twelve-pounder
Batteries of the First, Second, and Sixth Corps, drawn up with their
Left close upon the Charleroi road; of the four Divisional Foot
Batteries; of the Horse Battery belonging to <span class="smcap">Jaquinot</span>'s Light
Cavalry Brigade; and of the two Horse Batteries of <span class="smcap">Milhaud</span>'s
Corps of <i>Cuirassiers</i>, which stood in Second Line, in rear of
<span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s Corps&mdash;altogether seventy four guns.</p>

<p>This imposing force of Infantry, Cavalry, and Artillery, exclusive of
the ample Cavalry Reserves at hand, was not more than commensurate with
the importance of the object which <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> had in view. His
aim was not only to turn the Allied Left, but also to force the Centre
of the position; and, by gaining possession of the Farms of La Haye
Sainte and Mont St Jean, to cut off <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s main line of
communication by the high road to Brussels, and, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span> the same time,
to prevent any contemplated junction of the Prussian and Anglo-Allied
Armies.</p>

<p>This appeared to him preferable to any plan of operation against the
Allied Right, where the skilful dispositions made by the Duke would
require such a plan to embrace the attack and repulse of the troops
occupying Braine l'Alleud, and the Post of Vieux Foriez, as well as the
forcing of the position, <i>en potence</i>, held by Lord <span class="smcap">Hill</span>; a
consideration which, combined with a knowledge of the existence of a
considerable body of Allied troops near Hal, and the fear of allowing
himself to be induced into too great an extension of his own force
towards his Left, caused him to resign all idea of attempting any
movement of importance in that quarter.</p>

<p>He felt, moreover, that even a successful attack upon the Right would,
in all probability, induce the Duke to fall back upon the Prussians;
and thus effect that junction which it was his great object to
frustrate: whereas, an attack upon the Anglo-Allied Left, which was not
so strong, if successful, held out to him the prospect of his being
enabled, by aid of the presumed vigorous co-operation on the part of
<span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>, and the momentarily expected arrival of a portion of
that Marshal's forces on his own Right, to defeat both Armies in detail.</p>

<p>The Batteries had been regularly posted and fully prepared for action,
and the Infantry Columns had advanced to the inner brow of the
intervening ridge, when <span class="smcap">Ney</span> sent word to the Emperor that the
preliminary arrangements were completed, and that he only waited His
Majesty's Orders to commence the attack. <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> immediately
took a general view of the Field of Battle, and continuing his
observations beyond his Right, in order to discover, if possible, any
indication of the approach either of <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> or of a hostile
force, he perceived in the direction of St<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span> Lambert an indistinct mass,
having the appearance of a body of troops; and pointing out the object
to <span class="smcap">Soult</span>, who was near him at the time, asked his opinion;
whereupon the Marshal observed, that he really conceived it to be a
Column on the march, and that there was great reason to believe it
was a Detachment from <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>. All the Staff directed their
telescopes upon the point indicated; and, as the atmosphere was not
very clear, different opinions were entertained: some asserting that
what had been taken for troops were trees; others that they were
Columns in position; whilst several agreed with <span class="smcap">Soult</span>, that
they were troops on the march.</p>

<p>In this state of uncertainty and suspense, the Emperor sent for General
<span class="smcap">Domon</span>, and desired him to proceed instantly with a strong
reconnoitring party to the right, and procure correct intelligence;
to put himself quickly in communication with the troops approaching
from St Lambert; to effect a junction with them, if they belonged to
Marshal <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>, and to impede their advance if they proved
to be Enemies. At the same time, the two Light Cavalry Divisions of
<span class="smcap">Domon</span> and <span class="smcap">Subervie</span> proceeded some distance in the
direction of the Wood of Paris; and were then drawn up <i>en potence</i> to
the Right of the French Army.</p>

<p>Not long after <span class="smcap">Domon</span>'s departure, <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s
impatience to ascertain the precise character of the distant Column
was relieved by the arrival of an Officer of <i>Chasseurs</i> with a
Prussian Hussar, who had just been taken prisoner; and who was the
bearer of a letter, addressed by the Prussian General <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>
to the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, to acquaint the latter with his
arrival at St Lambert. The prisoner stated that the Column which was
perceptible in the vicinity of this Village, was the Advanced Guard of
<span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Corps, which had not been engaged at Ligny; that he
had been in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span> morning at Wavre; that the three other Prussian Corps
were stationed close to that town, and had passed the previous night
there, without perceiving any indication of an Enemy in their front;
and that a Patrol of his own Regiment had advanced, during the night,
as far as two leagues from Wavre without encountering any body of
French troops.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Soult</span> who had just at that moment written the following letter
to <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>, in reply to his Second Report from Gembloux,
immediately added a postscript, referring to the above intelligence,
and sent off the despatch, accompanied by the intercepted communication
and the Hussar's report.</p>

<p>The above letter is of much historical importance. Although conveying
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s approval of <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s movement upon
either Corbaix or Wavre, it clearly indicates the commencement of that
anxiety and uneasiness of mind which the Emperor experienced through
the fear of even the possibility of a want of just conception on the
part of the Marshal, of the true spirit in which the combination of his
movements with those of the main Army should be carried on. He draws
the Marshal's attention to the necessity of his man&oelig;uvring so as to
prevent the execution of any hostile design against the Right Flank of
the main Army, which is then engaged with <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s forces,
and names Mont St Jean, the Centre of the Duke's position, as a guiding
point. This anxiety was naturally augmented very considerably by the
discovery of <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s troops, and the postscript accordingly
enjoins still more urgently the necessity of a close and active
co-operation.</p>

<p>Very shortly after the Officer who was the bearer of this despatch had
started, a message was sent in by General <span class="smcap">Domon</span> to the effect
that his Scouts had fallen in with Detachments from the Enemy in the
direction of St<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span> Lambert; and that he had just sent out Patrols towards
other points to obtain intelligence of Marshal <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>, and to
communicate with him, if practicable.</p>

<p>It is to be observed, however, that the troops discovered by the French
Cavalry did not belong to <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s main body, but merely to
his Advanced Guard. The former was the mass first seen from La Belle
Alliance, when it was moving across the Heights of St Lambert, on the
right or opposite bank of the Lasne; but as explained in a preceding
Chapter, it encountered great obstruction and much delay during its
march towards the Field: whilst the latter, awaiting its arrival,
rested concealed in the Wood of Paris, near Lasne.</p>

<p>Thus it appears that both Commanders were deceived as to the proximity
of any considerable body of Prussians at this period of the day.
Nevertheless, the conviction of such a proximity, while it imparted
increased confidence to <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, in regard to the speedy
execution of the plan of combined operation which he had preconcerted
with <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, compelled <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> to employ additional
vigilance and circumspection upon his Right Flank.</p>

<p>Great, however, as was the necessity for such vigilance; the measures
that were adopted were lamentably deficient in energy, vigour, and
judgement. Considering that the main body of <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Corps
was on the point of entering the Defile of St Lambert, in which it had
to overcome the greatest difficulties; it appears unaccountable that
the Officer employed in reconnoitring and patroling beyond the extreme
Right of the French Army should not have urged the occupation of the
Wood of Paris with a detached body of Infantry, with a view to impede
<span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s advance, and compel him to take a more circuitous
route. In this manner the Prussian co-operation might have been so
far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span> obstructed or delayed as to secure to <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> the power
of advancing against <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> with almost the entire of
his force; and of thus, perhaps, accomplishing his grand object of
defeating both Armies in detail.</p>

<p>No disposition of this kind was made; but, in place of it,
<span class="smcap">Domon</span>'s and <span class="smcap">Subervie</span>'s Light Cavalry Divisions were
moved to the right, <i>en potence</i> to the Front Line, their Picquets not
extending beyond the plateau in front of the Wood of Paris. Whether
this culpable neglect arose from the want of due penetration and
foresight on the part of General <span class="smcap">Domon</span>; or from this Officer
having been instructed not to act as if in command of a detached
Corps, but only to take up a position, within a prescribed distance,
<i>en potence</i> to the general Front Line; or, from an over confident
expectation on the part of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> of approaching aid from
<span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>; are points not easily determined: but there can be
no doubt that the error of not occupying the Wood of Paris with a
strong body of Infantry, flanked and supported by the Cavalry, was
fatal to the development of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s original design. One
Infantry Division, combined with Domon's and <span class="smcap">Subervie</span>'s
Cavalry Divisions, would have sufficed for obstructing the debouching
of <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Corps from the almost impassable Defile of St
Lambert; and compelling it to move by its right, into the line of march
of <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Corps, which did not reach the field before seven
o'clock in the evening. To move by its left, along the deep and miry
valley of the Lasne, would have been impracticable so long as the Wood
of Paris and its vicinity continued to be occupied by the French.</p>

<p>In short, the importance of seizing upon the means that presented
themselves for materially retarding, if not of completely frustrating,
the co-operation of the principal portion of the Prussian forces,
was of so vital a nature, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span> the French Emperor would have been
justified in detaching the whole of <span class="smcap">Lobau</span>'s Corps, along with
the Cavalry already mentioned, under an experienced and enterprising
General, such as <span class="smcap">Lobau</span> himself, to operate against the
Prussians whilst these were occupied in passing the Defiles which
led to his Right Flank. None of those troops were engaged with the
Anglo-Allied Army during any part of the day; so that, without
diminishing the numbers actually opposed to the latter, they might have
been detached in the manner suggested: instead of remaining, as was
the case, drawn up <i>en potence</i> on the immediate Field of Action, to
be attacked by the Prussians, who were permitted to pass the Defiles
without interruption, to collect their forces under cover of the Wood
of Paris, to debouch from the latter successively and at their leisure,
and to organise their movements of attack in perfect security, and with
the most systematic order and regularity.</p>

<p class="drop">NAPOLEON, having taken the precaution of posting a Cavalry
Corps of Observation upon his Right Flank, no longer delayed sending
the Order to <span class="smcap">Ney</span> for the commencement of the Grand Attack upon
the Centre and Left Wing of the Anglo-Allied Army. About the same time,
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, considering that some of the Battalions along
the Right Wing of his Front Line were too much exposed to the Enemy's
cannonade, which had from the commencement been principally directed
against them, and which was now conducted with increased vigour,
withdrew them more under shelter of the crest of the ridge. It might
then be about half past one, or perhaps a quarter before two o'clock.</p>

<p>The simultaneous advance of <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s four Divisions of
Infantry, amounting to more than 16,000 men, was grand and imposing.
As the heads of the Columns cleared their own line of Batteries ranged
along the crest of the intervening ridge, and as the points on which
they were directed for attack opened out to their view, loud and
reiterated shouts arose from their ranks of "<i>Vive l'Empereur!</i>" which,
as the masses began to descend the exterior slope of their position,
were suddenly drowned in the roar produced by the discharge of seventy
four pieces of French cannon over their heads. The effects of the
latter upon <span class="smcap">Picton</span>'s Division, and upon <span class="smcap">Bylandt</span>'s
Dutch-Belgian Brigade, which, as before stated, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span> deployed upon the
exterior slope of the Anglo-Allied position, were severely felt.</p>

<p>Light Troops now issued forth from each Column, and soon spread out
into a line of Skirmishers extending the whole length of the valley.
As <span class="smcap">Donzelot</span>'s Division, which was on the left, approached
La Haye Sainte, one of its Brigades moved out to attack that Farm,
while the other continued its advance on the right of the Charleroi
road; and it was not long before a sharp fire of musketry along and
around the hedges of the Orchard of La Haye Sainte announced the first
resistance to <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s formidable advance. Shortly afterwards
a dropping fire commenced among the hedges and inclosures of Papelotte,
La Haye, and Smohain; which were occupied by the Nassau Battalions
under Prince <span class="smcap">Bernhard</span> of Saxe Weimar. The Right Brigade of
<span class="smcap">Durutte</span>'s Division was thrown out against the troops defending
these inclosures; while the Left Brigade continued to advance across
the valley, so as to form a Support to <span class="smcap">Marcognet</span>'s Division
on its left, and, at the same time, to connect this attack with the
advance of the latter against the main Front Line of the Allied Right
Wing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Durutte</span>'s Skirmishers pressed boldly forward against those
of Prince <span class="smcap">Bernhard</span>'s Brigade; and it was not long before
they succeeded in gaining possession of the Farm House of Papelotte,
driving out the Light Company of the 3rd Battalion of the 2nd Regiment
of Nassau, commanded by Captain <span class="smcap">Rettberg</span>; but the latter, on
being reinforced with four additional Companies, resumed the offensive,
and gallantly retook the Farm. The contest in this quarter was now
limited to a persistent skirmish; which extended itself along La Haye
and Smohain, occupied by the Regiment of Orange Nassau. With this
<i>tiraillade</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span> on either Flank of <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s Corps, the central
Columns pursued their onward course, and began to ascend the exterior
slope of the Allied position.</p>

<p class="figcenter" ><img src="images/illus22.jpg" alt="cap" />
<a id="illus22" name="illus22"></a></p>
<p class="caption">Battle of Waterloo</p>


<p>Immediately on the departure of <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s Corps from
the French position, <span class="smcap">Bachelu</span>'s Infantry Division, which
constituted the Right of <span class="smcap">Reille</span>'s Corps, was moved forward
to the immediate Height between La Belle Alliance and La Haye Sainte
(where it is intersected by the hollow way formed by the Charleroi
road), in order to maintain that point, to be at hand as a Reserve to
the attacking force, and to keep up the connection between the Right
and Left Wings of the Front Line of the French Army.</p>

<p>The three central Columns continued their Advance up the exterior slope
of the Allied position. The nature of the ground still admitted of the
play of the French Batteries over their heads, and great was the havoc
produced by this fire upon <span class="smcap">Picton</span>'s devoted ranks. As the
heads of the Columns neared the deployed Line of <span class="smcap">Bylandt</span>'s
Brigade, the shouts of "<i>Vive l'Empereur!</i>" were renewed. The
Skirmishers in advance had scarcely opened their fire upon the Brigade,
in order to prepare for, and give increased effect to, the succeeding
charge of the Columns; when the Dutch-Belgians, who had already evinced
a considerable degree of unsteadiness, began firing in their turn,
but with very little effect: immediately after which they commenced
a hurried retreat, not partially and promiscuously, but collectively
and simultaneously&mdash;so much so, that the movement carried with it
the appearance of its having resulted from a word of command. The
disorder of these troops rapidly augmented; but, on their reaching the
straggling hedge along the crest of the position, an endeavour was made
to rally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span> them upon the 5th Battalion of Dutch Militia. This attempt,
however, notwithstanding the most strenuous and praiseworthy exertions
on the part of the Officers, completely failed. The reserve Battalion
and the Artillerymen of Captain <span class="smcap">Byleveld</span>'s Battery, though
they seemed to stem the torrent for a moment, were quickly swept away
by its accumulating force. As they rushed past the British Columns,
hissings, hootings, and execrations were indignantly heaped upon them;
and one portion, in its eagerness to get away, nearly ran over the
Grenadier Company of the 28th British Regiment, the men of which were
so enraged, that it was with difficulty they could be prevented from
firing upon the fugitives. Some of the men of the 1st, or Royal Scots,
were also desirous of shooting them. Nothing seemed to restrain their
flight, which ceased only when they found themselves completely across
and covered by the main ridge along which the Anglo-Allied Army was
drawn up. Here they continued, comparatively under shelter, during
the remainder of the battle, as a Reserve; in which capacity alone,
considering their losses and their crippled state, they could now be
rendered serviceable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Picton</span>, who had been calmly watching the French movements,
and whose quick and practised eye detected the increasing unsteadiness
and wavering disposition of the Dutch-Belgians, appeared to expect but
a feeble resistance on their part; and upon his Aide de Camp, Captain
<span class="smcap">Tyler</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> remarking to him that he was sure they would run,
he said, "Never mind; they shall have a taste of it, at all events."
He had certainly not anticipated the possibility of their retiring so
precipitately as they did the moment the French came within musket
range of their ranks.</p>

<p>Now, however, that these troops had completely cleared away to the
rear, and left him no other means wherewith to brave the coming storm
than could be afforded by the shattered remnants of <span class="smcap">Kempt</span>'s
and <span class="smcap">Pack</span>'s Brigades which had survived the sanguinary Fight
of Quatre Bras, <span class="smcap">Picton</span> immediately deployed his force, and
assumed an attitude of patient but determined resistance. When the
disparity in relative numbers of the assailants and defenders is
considered, the attempt to make head with such odds, against the
advancing masses of an Enemy elated by his triumphant progress, was,
it must be admitted, a daring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span> and critical undertaking. Each Brigade
presented a thin two deep Line. Their united strength did not amount
to more than about 3,000 men; whilst of the French force, the central
attacking Columns alone, which were now advancing directly upon these
two Brigades, consisted of nearly 12,000 men. <span class="smcap">Picton</span> had,
moreover, no Infantry Reserve whatever, from which he could obtain
support in case of success, or upon which he could fall back in case of
disaster.</p>

<p>He was not, however, one to be daunted by the approach of heavy
Columns, formidable as they might appear in point of numbers, when
he could meet them with a well trained British Line, though it
should be but two deep, and present but a fourth of the numerical
force of its opponents. It is true, that nearly all the Regiments in
<span class="smcap">Kempt</span>'s and <span class="smcap">Pack</span>'s Brigades had lost half their
numbers in the Battle of the 16th; but <span class="smcap">Picton</span> well knew that
they had not lost that indomitable spirit, which, under his guidance,
had immortalised them on that memorable Field of Battle. There, he
had triumphantly led them both in Line against heavy Columns of
Infantry, and in Squares against charging Squadrons of Cavalry. What,
then, might not be achieved by such innate valour&mdash;by such consummate
discipline? The entire confidence which he reposed in his men was
warmly reciprocated on their part. With such a Chief to lead them, they
would have bravely confronted the whole French Army, had it been moving
in mass against them. The flight of the panic-stricken Dutch-Belgians
produced no effect upon them beyond that of exciting their derision and
contempt.</p>

<p>The 28th, 32nd, and 79th Regiments of <span class="smcap">Kempt</span>'s Brigade, when
deployed, occupied a Line parallel to, and about fifty yards distant
from, the hedge along the Wavre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span> road, its Right resting on a high
bank lining the Charleroi road, and its Left terminating at a point
in rear of that part of the Wavre road which begins to incline for a
short distance towards the left rear. In their right front, immediately
overlooking the intersection of the Charleroi and Wavre roads, stood
(as before stated) the Reserve of the 1st Battalion 95th Rifles; they
had two Companies, under Major <span class="smcap">Leach</span>, posted in the Sand
Pit adjoining the left of the Charleroi road; and one Company, under
Captain <span class="smcap">Johnston</span>, at the hedge on the Knoll in rear of the
Sand Pit. Their Commanding Officer Colonel Sir <span class="smcap">Andrew Barnard</span>,
and Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Cameron</span>, were with these Advanced
Companies, watching the Enemy's movements.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pack</span>'s Line was in left rear of <span class="smcap">Kempt</span>'s Brigade,
and about 150 yards distant from the Wavre road. Its Left rested upon
the Knoll between the Wavre road and a small coppice on the reverse
slope of the position; but the Centre and Right extended across a
considerable hollow which occurs on the right of that coppice. The
front of the interval between the two Brigades became, after the
retreat of the Dutch-Belgians, completely exposed and uncovered.</p>

<p>The French Left central attacking Column had continued its advance in
a direction contiguous to, and parallel with, the high road, until the
Skirmishers in front were suddenly checked by the Companies of the 95th
British Rifles posted in the Sand Pit; which obstacle had hitherto
been in a great measure concealed from their view by the particular
formation of the ground, combined with the height of the intervening
corn. Influenced by the discovery of this impediment, and by the
appearance of the <i>abatis</i> upon the high road, the Column inclined
to the right so as to clear the Sand Pit; and as their Skirmishers
were pressing on in that direction, the Companies of the 95th became
turned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span> and were forced to fall back upon the other Company stationed
along the little hedge in rear of the Pit. So vigorous and effective
was the fire maintained from this hedge by the British Riflemen, both
upon the Skirmishers and upon the Column itself, that the latter was
induced to swerve still further to the right, out of its original
direction.</p>

<p>The retreat of <span class="smcap">Bylandt</span>'s Brigade having removed all impediment
to the advance of the central attacking Columns, the three Companies of
the 95th soon found themselves outflanked by the French Skirmishers,
and gradually retired upon their Reserve. The Light Companies of the
other Regiments of <span class="smcap">Kempt</span>'s Brigade, which had moved out to
skirmish, fell back in like manner, accordingly as the French Columns
advanced. With a view to secure the Left Flank of the attacking force,
and at the same time to connect the movements with those on the
opposite side of the high road, the French presented a strong Line, or
rather a mass, of Skirmishers, in the interval between that road and
the Left central Column.</p>

<p>As the Columns now rapidly approached the crest of the Anglo-Allied
position, the greater part of the Batteries along the French
ridge&mdash;that is, all those which had been cannonading that portion of
the Line embraced by the attack&mdash;gradually suspended their fire. The
partial cessation of their thunder was immediately succeeded by loud
and reiterated shouts from the Columns of "<i>Vive l'Empereur!</i>"; whilst
at short intervals were heard the cheering exhortations of "<i>En avant!
en avant!</i>" mingled with the continued roll of drums beating the <i>pas
de charge</i>.</p>

<p>The Left central Column was advancing in a direction which would have
brought it in immediate contact with the Right of the 28th British
Regiment and the Left of the 79th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span> Highlanders, and had arrived within
about forty yards of the hedge lining the edge of the Wavre road, when
<span class="smcap">Picton</span> moved forward <span class="smcap">Kempt</span>'s Brigade close to the
hedge; where it was joined by its Light Companies, who came running in,
followed by some of the most daring of the French Skirmishers, who,
however, were quickly driven back. Suddenly the Column halted, and
commenced a deployment to its right, the rear Battalions moving out
rapidly to disengage their front.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Picton</span>, seizing upon the favourable moment, ordered the
Brigade to fire a volley into the deploying mass; and its brief but
full and condensed report had scarcely died away, when his voice
was heard loudly calling "Charge! charge! Hurrah!" Answering with a
tremendous shout, his devoted followers burst through the nearest of
the two hedges that lined the Wavre road. In doing this their order Was
in some degree broken; and, when making their way through the further
hedge, a fire was poured into them by such of their opponents as had
their front uncovered. The Enemy's Skirmishers that had previously
fallen back upon the Flanks of the Column instantly darted forward;
and by their rapid and close telling fire assisted in the endeavour
to augment the apparent disorder of <span class="smcap">Kempt</span>'s line. The 79th
Highlanders suffered greatly, and experienced some delay in clearing
the hedges. The Ensign (<span class="smcap">Birtwhistle</span>) carrying the Regimental
Colour of the 32nd, was severely wounded. Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Belcher</span>,
who commanded the left centre subdivision, took the Colour from him.
In the next moment it was seized by a French Officer, whose horse had
just been shot under him. A struggle ensued between him and Lieutenant
<span class="smcap">Belcher</span>; but, while the former was attempting to draw his
sword, the covering Colour Sergeant (named <span class="smcap">Switzer</span>) gave
him a thrust in the breast with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span> halbert, and the right hand man
of the subdivision (named <span class="smcap">Lacy</span>) shot him, just as Brevet
Major <span class="smcap">Toole</span>, commanding the right centre subdivision, called
out, though too late (for the French Officer fell dead at Lieutenant
<span class="smcap">Belcher</span>'s feet), "Save the brave fellow!" The delay in
crossing the hedges was but momentary; order was speedily restored:
and then, levelling their bayonets, the Brigade disclosed to view the
glorious sight of a British Line of Infantry at the charge.</p>

<p>It was during this brief struggle that a severe and irreparable blow
was inflicted upon the entire British Army, and a whole nation plunged
into grief and mourning for the loss of a Chief; the brilliancy
of whose career had so excited her admiration, and the fame of
whose exploits had so exalted her pride. The truly brave and noble
<span class="smcap">Picton</span> was struck by a musket ball on the right temple. His
death, which was instantaneous, was first observed by the Earl of
<span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span>'s Aide de Camp, Captain <span class="smcap">Horace Seymour</span>;
whom he was, at the moment, desiring to rally the Highlanders. Captain
<span class="smcap">Seymour</span>, whose horse was just then falling, immediately
called the attention of <span class="smcap">Picton</span>'s Aide de Camp, Captain
<span class="smcap">Tyler</span>, to the fact of the General having been wounded; and, in
the next moment, the hero's lifeless corpse was, with the assistance of
a private soldier of the nearest Regiment, borne from off his charger
by that Officer. Thus fell the gallant soldier, who, as the Leader of
the Third or "Fighting Division" in the Peninsular War, had already
acquired an imperishable renown in the history of the British Army. As
his life was spent in fighting the battles of his country, his death
was an end suited to his stirring career. His brave spirit passed away
amidst the roar and din of the bloody conflict, and his eyes closed on
his last of Fields in the very moment of the advance of his troops to
victory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span></p>

<p>The French Column, surprised in the midst of its attempted deployment,
and appalled by the bold and determined onset of <span class="smcap">Kempt</span>'s Line,
appeared as if struck by a panic, fell into irremediable confusion,
and fled with precipitation from its pursuers. Just as the British
Brigade bore down the slope, its front was partially crossed from the
right by French <i>Cuirassiers</i>, followed by the 2nd British Life Guards;
the former, dashing in amongst their own thickly scattered Infantry
Skirmishers; who threw themselves down to allow both fugitives and
pursuers to ride over them, and then, in many cases, rose up and fired
after the latter. But although the greater part of the <i>Cuirassiers</i>
turned about and boldly faced their opponents, whereby several isolated
individual contests occurred; the 2nd Life Guards soon obtained the
mastery, and compelled them to resume their flight: whilst the 95th
Rifles speedily closed upon the disordered mass of Infantry through
which this portion of the Cavalry had passed, and amongst which the
greatest confusion and consternation prevailed. Many flew wildly they
scarcely knew whither; others delivered themselves up; and several were
seized as prisoners.</p>

<p>On its right, the Brigade was supported in the charge by the 1st Light
Battalion of the King's German Legion; which crossed over for that
purpose from the opposite side of the high road.</p>

<p>Immediately after passing through the hedge, the extreme Left of the
28th Regiment had unexpectedly found itself almost in contact with a
well formed French Column still advancing against the Allied position.
The Right Wing of the Regiment was too deeply engaged with the Column
directly before it to admit of its attention being drawn off to any
other quarter; but the Left Wing, having a clearer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span> front, boldly
brought forward its right shoulders, thus detaching itself from the
Right Wing, and fired into the Left Flank of the advancing Column at
the very moment when the head of the latter was charged by the Right
Regiment (the Royals) of <span class="smcap">Ponsonby</span>'s Brigade of Heavy Cavalry.
<span class="smcap">Kempt</span>, becoming aware of the prolongation of the French attack
along the Line to his left, and of the consequently exposed state of
this Flank; and possessing no Infantry Support or Reserve of any kind,
felt himself under the necessity of restraining his men from further
pursuit, and ordered the Brigade to halt and reform. The Left Wing of
the 28th, however, having its whole attention fixed upon the Column
charged by the Royals, followed these Dragoons some distance down the
slope, and assisted them in securing a great number of prisoners; after
which it fell back, and rejoined the Right Wing of the Regiment. The
95th Rifles continued advancing, and driving the French Skirmishers
before them beyond the Knoll by the Sand Pit.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From this extremely gallant and most decisive attack by
<span class="smcap">Kempt</span>'s Brigade, we must proceed to describe the no
less brilliant charges performed by both <span class="smcap">Somerset</span>'s and
<span class="smcap">Ponsonby</span>'s Cavalry Brigades; but to afford a more ready
comprehension of this period of the action, it will be necessary, in
the first instance, to revert, to the attack and defence of La Haye
Sainte.</p>

<p>The French Skirmishers thrown out by the Left Brigade of
<span class="smcap">Donzelot</span>'s Division advanced boldly and resolutely against
the Orchard of La Haye Sainte. The first shot tore away the bridle of
Major <span class="smcap">Baring</span>'s horse close to his hand, and the second killed
Major <span class="smcap">Bösewiel</span>, the next in command. The three Companies of
the 2nd Light Battalion of the King's German Legion, which, as before
stated, were posted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span> in the Orchard, together with two Companies of
the 1st Light Battalion of the King's German Legion under Captains
<span class="smcap">Wynecken</span> and <span class="smcap">Goeden</span>, and a Company of Hanoverian
Riflemen under Major <span class="smcap">Spörken</span>, which were extended on the right
of the Farm, presented a gallant resistance to the Enemy; but the
latter continued to press forward with superior force, and the main
body of the French Brigade having formed two Columns of Attack, which
were rapidly advancing, one into the Orchard, and the other towards the
Buildings, Major <span class="smcap">Baring</span> fell back with his men upon the Barn.</p>

<p>At this moment, Colonel <span class="smcap">Klencke</span> reached the Farm with the
Lüneburg Field Battalion; which <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, on observing the
French advance, had detached from the Left of <span class="smcap">Kielmansegge</span>'s
Brigade as a reinforcement to the troops of La Haye Sainte.
<span class="smcap">Baring</span> immediately endeavoured to recover the Orchard; and
had already made the Enemy give way, when he perceived a strong Line
of <i>Cuirassiers</i> forming in right front of the inclosure. At the
same time, Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Meyer</span> came to report to him that the
Enemy had surrounded the Garden in which his Company was posted, and
that it had become no longer tenable. <span class="smcap">Baring</span> ordered him to
fall back into the Buildings, and to assist in their defence. The
Skirmishers upon the right, on the sudden appearance of the Cavalry,
ran in upon the Orchard to collect together: but coming in contact with
the newly arrived Hanoverians, the latter got into disorder; and the
effect produced by the sight of the advancing Line of <i>Cuirassiers</i>
in their front, as also by the shouts of the French Infantry gaining
possession of the Garden in their rear, was such, that notwithstanding
all <span class="smcap">Baring</span>'s exertions to halt and collect his men, the whole
of these troops betook themselves to an indiscriminate flight towards
the main position of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span> the Allied Army, a course which they seemed to
imagine constituted their only chance of safety.</p>

<p>They were speedily undeceived. The Cavalry overtook them in the midst
of their confused retreat, rode over, sabred, and still further
dispersed them; whilst, to add to the severity of their loss, they
became exposed, after the Cavalry had passed on, to a flank fire from
the Enemy's Infantry lining the hedge of the Garden. A portion of
them succeeded in gaining the main position; whilst the remainder,
securing themselves in the Buildings, augmented the little garrison
under Lieutenants <span class="smcap">Carey</span> and <span class="smcap">Græme</span>, and Ensign
<span class="smcap">Frank</span>, who bravely and successfully maintained possession
in defiance of the vigorous attacks on the part of the French Light
Troops. The Lüneburg Hanoverian Battalion, however, suffered most
severely: many were killed and wounded; among the latter was the
Commanding Officer, Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Klencke</span>, and among
the prisoners taken was Major <span class="smcap">Dachenhausen</span>. Some on the left
saved themselves by a precipitate retreat into the high road. The few
that were collected together again during the remainder of the day
constituted but a very insignificant portion of the original strength
of the Battalion.</p>

<p>The Earl of <span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span>, on perceiving the advance of the French
Cavalry by La Haye Sainte, on the British right of the Charleroi road
(the same alluded to as having dispersed the Hanoverian Lüneburg
Battalion and <span class="smcap">Baring</span>'s Skirmishers of the Legion), as also
the approach of the Infantry Columns which constituted the attack upon
the Allied Left Wing on the opposite side of that road, decided upon a
simultaneous charge by the Heavy Cavalry Brigades of Lord <span class="smcap">Edward
Somerset</span> and Sir <span class="smcap">William Ponsonby</span>; the former against
the Enemy's Cavalry, the latter against his masses of Infantry. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
resolution was scarcely formed when he proceeded to carry it into
instant execution. Riding up to Lord <span class="smcap">Edward Somerset</span>, he
ordered him to prepare to form Line, keeping the Blues in support: and
galloping on to <span class="smcap">Ponsonby</span>'s Brigade on the opposite side of the
high road, he ordered that Officer to wheel into Line as soon as he saw
the other Brigade do so, and to hold the Scots Greys in support. He
then returned to the Household Brigade, and immediately put the whole
in motion.</p>

<p>As this was the first grand attack made by the French on that day
in fair open Field, Lord <span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span> felt very desirous, in
meeting it, to establish, if possible, the superior prowess of the
British Cavalry; and thus to inspire it with confidence, and cause it
to be held in respect by its opponents. He, therefore, with a view
to excite the courage and heighten the enthusiasm of his followers,
led the advance in person, placing himself in front of the Left of
<span class="smcap">Somerset</span>'s Brigade, so as to be at about the centre of the
Line when the Brigades should unite, on the continuation of the
advance, in front of the Allied position. Nobly and faithfully did
these brave Dragoons fulfil his anxious expectations.</p>

<p>For the purpose of ensuring efficient support to his Cavalry attacks,
Lord <span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span> had, before the commencement of the Battle,
intimated to the Generals of Brigade that as he could not be present
everywhere to give Orders, he expected they would always take upon
themselves to conform to, and support, offensive movements in their
front; and having on this occasion Light Cavalry Brigades on either
Flank of the charging force, he felt in a great degree justified in
placing himself in Front Line, particularly as he had assigned to each
of the advancing Brigades its own immediate Support.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span></p>

<p>Though greatly palliated by the adoption of these precautionary
measures, this was perhaps not altogether a prudent act on the part
of the Commander of the entire Cavalry of an Army; since, in the
charge of an extended Line of Cavalry against an Enemy close at
hand, the <i>carrière</i> once begun, the Leader becomes so completely
identified and mixed up with that Line itself, that his virtual command
is rapidly limited to that of a Squadron Officer; whereas, when
accompanying a <i>Second</i> Line, he is enabled to draw off, or reinforce,
as circumstances may render expedient. His eager desire, however, to
render this first charge a brilliant affair, combined with his own
chivalric nature, led him to assume the post of honour and of danger,
in order to animate by his example as a bold and determined soldier. At
the same time, he trusted to the dispositions he had already made, and
to the alertness of his Brigadiers, for due support to his attack; but
which, from fortuitous circumstances, as will be seen by the sequel,
was not forthcoming at the moment it was most urgently required.</p>

<p>The French Line of Cavalry, as it advanced, presented an imposing
appearance. These veteran warriors bore with them an air of confident
superiority and anticipated triumph, joined with a sort of <i>gaieté de
c&oelig;ur</i>, inspired no doubt by the reflection that they were about to
encounter and overthrow their most implacable Enemies, the British.
Their advance, like that of the Infantry on their right, had been to a
certain extent triumphant; and, as the flight of the Dutch-Belgians had
led that Infantry to imagine that victory was already within its grasp,
so the dispersion of the Hanoverians was hailed by these Dragoons as a
happy prelude to their grand attack. They had now ascended the brow of
the ridge on which the Anglo-Allied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span> Infantry was posted, prepared for
their reception: a vigorous fire was opened upon them by the four guns
of Ross's British Horse Battery on the right of the high road, as also
by <span class="smcap">Lloyd</span>'s British Foot Battery still further to the right;
but a few seconds sufficed to restore the order of their advance: in
the next moment their trumpets sounded the charge; when, amidst shouts
of "<i>Vive l'Empereur!</i>" this gallant Line, glittering in all the
splendour reflected from burnished helmet and cuirass, rushed on to the
attack.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the British Household Brigade, presenting a
beautiful Line, and animated by an equal degree of enthusiasm, had
already been put into charging speed; and just as the <i>Cuirassiers</i>
came close upon the Squares, and received a fire from their front
faces, the two Lines dashed into each other with indescribable
impetuosity. The shock was terrific.</p>

<p>The British, in order to close as much as possible upon the
<i>Cuirassiers</i>, whose swords were much longer, and whose bodies were
encased in steel, whilst their own were without such defence, seemed
for a moment striving to wedge themselves in between the horses of
their infuriated antagonists. Swords gleamed high in air with the
suddenness and rapidity of the lightning flash, now clashing violently
together, and now clanging heavily upon resisting armour; whilst with
the din of the battle shock were mingled the shouts and yells of the
combatants. Riders vainly struggling for mastery quickly fell under
the deadly thrust or the well delivered cut. Horses, plunging and
rearing, staggered to the earth, or broke wildly from their ranks. But
desperate and bloody as was the struggle, it was of brief duration. The
physical superiority of the British, aided by transcendant valour, was
speedily made manifest; and the <i>Cuirassiers</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span> notwithstanding their
most gallant and resolute resistance, were driven down from off the
ridge, which they had ascended only a few minutes before with all the
pride and confidence of men accustomed and determined to overcome every
obstacle. This first collision at the charge did not occur, however,
throughout the entire extent of the opposing Lines. <span class="smcap">Somerset</span>'s
Line was not parallel to that of the <i>Cuirassiers</i>, and as its Right
was thrown somewhat forward, this came first in contact with the Enemy,
and the collision, in consequence of the rapidity of the charge on
both sides, followed in instantaneous succession in the direction of
the Allied Left until intercepted in its further progress by a natural
obstruction consisting of the hollow way through which the cross
roads lead into the Charleroi road. The <i>Cuirassiers</i> on the right
of the French Line were suddenly thrown out of their speed by coming
unexpectedly on this hollow way, into which they consequently descended
abruptly and confusedly; and as they began to urge their horses up the
opposite bank, they beheld the 2nd British Life Guards, which formed
the Left of <span class="smcap">Somerset</span>'s Brigade, in full speed towards them.
All idea of resistance, in such a situation, was abandoned as hopeless.
They immediately filed away down this hollow way to their right, and
struck across the Charleroi road into the field in front of the 95th
British Rifles; followed by the 2nd Life Guards, who were in equal
disorder from having to pick their way as they best could down the
steep banks adjoining the intersection of the two roads.</p>

<p>These <i>Cuirassiers</i>, after having rushed in upon the French Infantry
Skirmishers thickly and confusedly congregated in that quarter, reined
in their steeds, and fronting their pursuers, engaged them individually
in hand to hand combat. They were soon, however, made sensible of
their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span> inferiority in this species of contest, and either submitted
to the victors, or fled with precipitation; whilst at the same time,
<span class="smcap">Kempt</span>'s Brigade was charging gloriously down the exterior
slope of the Allied position, and closing upon the Infantry with which
these horsemen had become intermingled, in the manner previously
described.</p>

<p>No sooner did <span class="smcap">Ponsonby</span> perceive the Household Cavalry in
motion, than in pursuance of the Orders he had received, he led on his
own Brigade; but not being sufficiently aware of the state of affairs
on the opposite side of the Wavre road, and not wishing to launch
his Line against the Enemy's masses until the favourable moment had
arrived, he commanded a temporary halt, and rode up to the hedge in
order that he might, by personal observation, ensure the correct timing
of the charge. He was accompanied by Colonel <span class="smcap">Muter</span>, commanding
the Inniskilling Dragoons; whom he desired to return and place himself
in front of the Centre Squadron, and to order and conduct the movement,
the moment he should observe him hold up his cocked hat as a signal.</p>

<p>It is necessary to remark that the Scots Greys, who stood in support
some short time previously to this advance, just where the Enemy's
round shot, after passing over the ridge in front, descended in quick
succession and occasioned some losses in their ranks, were ordered to
some lower ground in left rear of the other two Regiments; which new
position they had scarcely reached when the latter were advanced as
above, and the Greys immediately conformed to this movement.</p>

<p>During the advance of <span class="smcap">Alix</span>'s French Division (the First), its
rear Brigade, which consisted of the 54th and 55th Regiments, inclined
to its right, moved out of the mass, and formed two Columns, of two
Battalions each, in support,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span> <i>en échelon</i> to the leading Brigade,
consisting of the 28th and 105th Regiments. In like manner, the rear
Brigade of <span class="smcap">Marcognet</span>'s Division (the Third), consisting of
the 21st and 46th Regiments, broke into two Columns, of two Battalions
each, in support, <i>en échelon</i> to, but more immediately in rear of, the
leading Brigade, consisting of the 25th and 45th Regiments.</p>

<p>While <span class="smcap">Kempt</span>'s Brigade was bravely charging down the slope
on the right, the heads of the leading Brigades of <span class="smcap">Alix</span>'s
and <span class="smcap">Marcognet</span>'s Divisions, with conspicuous gallantry, and
amidst shouts of triumph, crowned the crest of the Allied position
on the left, crossing the Wavre road and the straggling hedge, by
which their order had been in some degree disturbed. <span class="smcap">Alix</span>'s
leading Brigade, having passed clear of <span class="smcap">Kempt</span>'s Left,
found itself unopposed by Infantry, in its front; but the head of
<span class="smcap">Marcognet</span>'s Column, after passing close by the right of
Captain <span class="smcap">Rettberg</span>'s Hanoverian Foot Battery, from which it had
received a very destructive fire, during its advance, beheld a short
but compact line of Highlanders directly in its front.</p>

<p>This was the remnant of the 92nd Regiment which had so gallantly
fought, and so greatly suffered, at Quatre Bras. It did not at that
moment consist of more than 230 men, whilst the opposing Column
numbered about 2,000. <span class="smcap">Pack</span>, who was in front of the 92nd,
on seeing the head of the French Column making its way through the
hedge, resolved in his own mind that not a moment must be allowed
to it for observation and reflection, as otherwise the French would
succeed in establishing themselves in great force on the summit of
the British position. He instantly decided upon a measure, which, in
daring and determination, was fully commensurate with the emergency of
the occasion. Addressing himself to the Highlanders, he said, in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
energetic tone, "92nd, you must charge&mdash;all in front of you have given
way!" With loud cheers, and under the animating sounds of their native
pibroch, the 92nd moved steadily on with the noble mien and gallant
bearing of men bent upon upholding, at any sacrifice, the honour and
glory of their country. That portion of the French Column which had by
this time crossed the hedge was in perfect order, and presented a bold
and determined front. As the 92nd approached the Column, it received
from it a fire; which, however, it did not return, but continued to
advance steadily until it had arrived within twenty or thirty yards
distance, when the head of the French Column appeared panic struck,
and facing about in the greatest confusion, endeavoured to escape; the
Highlanders, at the same moment, throwing into the mass a concentrated
fire, most destructive in its effects. The 92nd immediately charged;
but at this very moment <span class="smcap">Ponsonby</span>'s Brigade came up.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Muter</span> had just before perceived the raised cocked hat,
when he instantly ordered and conducted the advance of the Brigade. It
will be recollected that the Scots Greys had been ordered to support
the Royals and Inniskillings; but having as was before explained,
moved down into lower ground on the left, to get more under cover
from the Enemy's cannonade, and subsequently advanced in left rear of
those two Regiments, they beheld in their direct front the head of
<span class="smcap">Marcognet</span>'s Division establishing itself on the height. Their
course from that moment was obvious. They soon got up into Line, or
nearly so, with the remainder of the Brigade, and joined in the general
charge.</p>

<p>Upon <span class="smcap">Ponsonby</span>'s Brigade coming up with the Infantry, it
passed through the latter as well, and as quickly as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span> could: in
some instances intervals were made for the Dragoons by the wheeling
of companies; in others, by that of subdivisions or of sections: but
generally the passage was effected in rather an irregular manner;
and under the circumstances this was unavoidable. Of the remaining
Regiments of <span class="smcap">Pack</span>'s Brigade, the 44th, which formed the Left,
having its front covered by <span class="smcap">Best</span>'s Hanoverians, remained in
support, on the summit or Knoll immediately above, and on the left of,
the hollow in which the rest of the Brigade had been posted. The 1st
Royal Scots, and the 42nd Highlanders on the right of the 92nd, moved
forward immediately after the advance by the latter, and crossing the
hedge, assisted <span class="smcap">Ponsonby</span>'s Cavalry in securing prisoners.</p>

<p>As the Scots Greys passed through, and mingled with, the Highlanders;
the enthusiasm of both Corps was extraordinary. They mutually cheered.
"Scotland for ever!" was their war shout. The smoke in which the
head of the French Column was enshrouded had not cleared away, when
the Greys dashed into the mass. So eager was the desire, so strong
the determination, of the Highlanders to aid their compatriots in
completing the work so gloriously begun, that many were seen holding on
by the stirrups of the horsemen; while all rushed forward, leaving none
but the disabled in their rear. The leading portion of the Column soon
yielded to this infuriated onset; the remainder, which was yet in the
act of ascending the exterior slope, appalled by the sudden appearance
of Cavalry at a moment when, judging by the sound of musketry fire in
front, they had naturally concluded that it was with Infantry alone
they had to contend, were hurled back in confusion by the impetus of
the shock. The Dragoons, having the advantage of the descent, appeared
to mow down the mass; which, bending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span> under the pressure, quickly
spread itself outwards in all directions. Yet, in that mass were many
gallant spirits, who could not be brought to yield without a struggle;
and these fought bravely to the death: not that they served to impede,
but only to mark more strongly the course of the impetuous torrent
as it swept wildly past them, presenting to the eye of the artistic
observer those streaks which, arising incidentally from such partial
and individual contests, invariably characterize the track of a charge
of Cavalry.</p>

<p>Within that mass too, was borne the Imperial Eagle of the 45th
Regiment, proudly displaying on its banner the names of Austerlitz,
Jena, Friedland, Essling, and Wagram&mdash;Fields in which this Regiment
had covered itself with glory, and acquired the distinguished title
of "The Invincibles." A devoted band encircled the sacred Standard,
which attracted the observation, and excited the ambition of a
daring and adventurous soldier, named <span class="smcap">Ewart</span>, a Sergeant of
the Greys. After a desperate struggle, evincing on his part great
physical strength combined with extraordinary dexterity, he succeeded
in capturing the cherished trophy. The gallant fellow was directed to
proceed with it to Brussels, where he was received with acclamations by
thousands who came forward to welcome and congratulate him.</p>

<p>Without pausing for a moment to reform, those of the Greys who
had forced their way through, or on either Flank of, the mass,
rushed boldly onward against the leading supporting Column of
<span class="smcap">Marcognet</span>'s right Brigade. This body of men, lost in amazement
at the suddenness, the wildness, of the charge; and its terrific
effects upon their countrymen on the higher ground in front, had either
not taken advantage of the very few moments that had inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>vened, by
preparing an effectual resistance to Cavalry; or, if they attempted
the necessary formation, did so when there was no longer time for its
completion. Their outer Files certainly opened a fire which proved very
destructive to their assailants; but to such a degree had the impetus
of the charge been augmented by the rapidly increasing descent of the
slope, that these brave Dragoons possessed as little of the power as of
the will to check their speed, and they plunged down into the mass with
a force that was truly irresistible. Its foremost ranks driven back
with irrepressible violence, the entire Column tottered for a moment,
and then sank under the overpowering wave. Hundreds were crushed to
rise no more; and hundreds rose again but to surrender to the victors;
who speedily swept their prisoners to the rear, while the Highlanders
secured those taken from the leading Column.</p>

<p>Along the remainder of the Line, the charge of the "Union Brigade" was
equally brilliant and successful. On the right, the Royal Dragoons,
by inclining somewhat to their left, during the advance, brought
their Centre Squadron to bear upon the head of the leading Column of
<span class="smcap">Alix</span>'s Division, which had crossed the hedges lining the Wavre
road, and being unchecked, was rapidly advancing across the crest of
the ridge. Suddenly its loud shouts of triumph ceased as it perceived
the close approach of Cavalry up the interior slope of the Anglo-Allied
position. Whether it was actuated by a consciousness of danger from
the disorder necessarily occasioned in its rear by the passage through
the banked up hedges, by a dread of being caught in the midst of any
attempt to assume a formation better adapted for effective resistance,
or of being entirely cut off from all support, it is difficult to
decide, but the head of this Column certainly appeared to be seized
with a panic. Having thrown out an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span> irregular and scattering fire,
which served only to bring down about twenty of the Dragoons; it
instantly faced about, and endeavoured to regain the opposite side of
the hedges. The Royals, however, were slashing in amongst them before
this object could be effected. The rear ranks of the Column, still
pressing forward, and unconscious of the obstruction in front, now met
those that were hurled back upon them down the exterior slope by the
charge of the Royals, who continued pressing forward against both Front
and Flanks of the mass. The whole was in a moment so jammed together
as to have become perfectly helpless, Men tried in vain to use their
muskets, which were either jerked out of their hands, or discharged at
random, in the attempt. Gradually, a scattering flight from the rear
loosened the unmanageable mass, which now rolled back helplessly along
its downward course. Many brave spirits, hitherto pent up in the midst
of the throng, appeared disposed to hazard a defiance; and amongst
these the swords of the Royals dealt fearful havoc: many threw down
their arms, and gave themselves up in despair; and these were hurried
off by the conquerors to the rear of the British Line.</p>

<p>The 28th French Regiment, which formed a direct Support to the 105th
Regiment, comprising the Column thus attacked, though astounded by
the scene before it, and almost driven back by the panic stricken
fugitives, still retained a considerable semblance of order.</p>

<p>Amidst the crowd that was now precipitating itself on this supporting
Column, to seek its shelter and protection, was an Officer, the bearer
of the Eagle of the 105th Regiment. This Standard, on which were
inscribed the victories of Jena, Eylau, Eckmühl, Essling, and Wagram,
was accompanied at the moment by a party apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span> forming a guard
for its defence. Captain <span class="smcap">Clark</span>, commanding the Centre Squadron
of the Royals, on discovering the group, instantly gave the Order,
"Right shoulders forward&mdash;attack the Colour!" and led directly upon
the Eagle himself. On reaching it, he ran his sword through the body
of the Standard Bearer who immediately fell, and the Eagle dropped
across the head of Captain <span class="smcap">Clark</span>'s horse. He endeavoured to
catch it with his left hand, but could only touch the fringe of the
Colour, and it would probably have fallen to the ground, and have been
lost in the confusion of the moment, had it not been saved by Corporal
<span class="smcap">Stiles</span>; who, having been Standard Coverer, and therefore
posted immediately in rear of the Squadron Leader, came up at the
instant, on Captain <span class="smcap">Clark</span>'s left, and caught the Colour as it
struck, in falling, against his own horse's neck.</p>

<p>So great were the confusion and dismay created in the second Column by
the rush towards it of the disorganised remnant of the leading body,
mixed up as it were with the Dragoons still pressing eagerly forward,
as also by the signal overthrow of the Columns on their right by the
Inniskillings, that the entire mass speedily yielded to the pressure,
and commenced a disorderly flight, pursued by the Royals to the foot of
the valley by which the two positions were divided.</p>

<p>The Inniskillings, forming the Centre Regiment of the Brigade, did not
come quite so soon into contact with the French Infantry as did the
Flank Regiments. The Columns in their immediate front were the two
formed by the 54th and 55th French Regiments, of two Battalions each;
which, as previously explained, advanced in support, and in right
rear, of <span class="smcap">Alix</span>'s leading Brigade. Only the Left, and part of
the Centre, Squadron of the Inniskillings had to pass through British
Infantry as they advanced; the front of the Right Squadron was clear.
The Irish "<i>hurrah!</i>" loud, wild, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span> shrill, rent the air as the
Inniskillings, bursting through the hedge and bounding over the road,
dashed boldly down the slope towards the French Columns, which were
about a hundred yards distant; an interval that imparted an additional
impetus to their charge, and assisted in securing for it a result
equally brilliant with that obtained by the other two Regiments. The
Right and Centre Squadrons bore down upon the 55th French Regiment;
while the Left Squadron alone charged the 54th Regiment. These two
Columns, like those on their right and left, were not allowed time to
recover from their astonishment at the unexpected, sudden, and vehement
charge of Cavalry launched against them. A feeble and irregular fire
was the only attempt they made to avert the impending danger. In the
next instant the Dragoons were amongst them, plying their swords with
fearful swiftness and dexterity, and cleaving their way into the midst
of the masses; which, rolling back, and scattering outwards, presented
an extraordinary scene of confusion. In addition to the destruction
effected by this Regiment, the number of prisoners which it secured was
immense.</p>

<p>The Household Brigade continued its charge down the slope on the right,
and partly on the left, of La Haye Sainte, with the most distinguished
gallantry and success; and bringing their right shoulders forward, the
1st Life Guards pressed severely on the rear of the <i>Cuirassiers</i>, as
a very considerable portion of them rushed tumultuously towards that
part of the high road beyond the Orchard of La Haye Sainte which lies
between high banks, and which was thus completely choked up with the
fugitives. Many of those who found their retreat so seriously impeded,
again faced their opponents, and a desperate hand to hand contest
ensued; which, however, was suddenly terminated by a destructive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
fire poured down upon the 1st Life Guards, from the top of the banks,
by the Light Troops of <span class="smcap">Bachelu</span>'s Division that crowned the
Heights through which the road has been excavated. The King's Dragoon
Guards, leaving this struggle on their right, and rattling across the
<i>pavé</i>, boldly ascended the Enemy's position. They were joined on their
left, by the 2nd Life Guards, whose course had been by the left of La
Haye Sainte. With these were now mingled Royals and Inniskillings,
while further to the left were the Greys&mdash;the whole Line, without even
any semblance of regularity, madly pursuing their wild career, as if
intoxicated with the excess of triumph.</p>

<p>Then it was that Lord <span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span>, who had so gallantly led the
charge in person, and incited all by his example, eagerly sought for
the Support on which he had confidently calculated; when, to his great
surprise and mortification, he discovered that there was none at hand.
<span class="smcap">Ponsonby</span>'s own immediate Support, which Lord <span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span>
himself had ordered to be formed by the Greys, had necessarily been
employed in Front Line on the left, in the manner described; a fact
of which, from his own position as Leader of that Line, he had been
quite unaware. The direct Support of <span class="smcap">Somerset</span>'s Brigade,
consisting of the Blues, had, during the charge, come up with, and
joined, the Front Line. The Regiment was kept well in hand; and, by its
comparatively good order, facilitated the drawing off of the remainder
of that Brigade from further pursuit. But it was on the left of the
high road, in rear of <span class="smcap">Ponsonby</span>'s Line, that support was most
needed. His Lordship could not account for the circumstance of neither
of the Light Cavalry Brigades, posted on the extreme Left, having
come up in support of <span class="smcap">Ponsonby</span>'s advance, in conformity with
the general instructions conveyed to his Brigadiers on the subject
of affording mutual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span> support. The fact is, that <span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span>'s
Brigade, which was the nearest, was then in motion for the purpose of
affording its aid; but its progress was unfortunately impeded by its
having previously to make a retrograde movement in order to pass a
hollow way which separated it from the troops on the right. In vain
did Lord <span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span> sound to halt and rally&mdash;neither voice nor
trumpet was heeded.</p>

<p>In a few seconds more, the Advanced Line was seen crowning the Enemy's
position. The King's Dragoon Guards were suddenly exposed to a severe
fire from the Batteries and from <span class="smcap">Bachelu</span>'s Columns of Infantry
on their right; and perceiving a strong and well formed body of
<i>Cuirassiers</i> on the point of advancing from the hollow beyond the
ridge they had so rashly ascended, they, with such of the Royals and
Inniskillings as had joined them, at length commenced a hasty retreat.
The Greys, along with many of the Royals and Inniskillings, dashed in
amongst the Batteries, and then, wheeling sharply to their left, rode
along the line of cannon in that direction, sabring the Gunners and
stabbing the horses, until they became sensible of the approach of a
body of French Lancers moving down obliquely from the left upon the
arena of this memorable conflict. They now fell back; but, with their
horses blown and exhausted, it was not long before they were overtaken
by the Lancers. These formed the Advance of <span class="smcap">Jacquinot</span>'s
Light Cavalry Brigade, which had been unaccountably remiss in not
having afforded a prompt and close Support to the attacking Columns of
Infantry.</p>

<p>Both the British Heavy Cavalry Brigades were now in full retreat.
<span class="smcap">Somerset</span>'s regained the position without any serious
molestation: but <span class="smcap">Ponsonby</span>'s Dragoons, particularly the
Greys, who were upon the extreme Left, suffered severely from
<span class="smcap">Jaquinot</span>'s Lancers and <i>Chasseurs</i>, the greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span> part of them
being in a state of the utmost confusion and exhaustion; whilst the
latter were infinitely superior in numerical force, were in good order,
and mounted on horses perfectly fresh. On their right the Lancers
charged in Open Column; the remainder, extending in open Lancer order
towards their left, rapidly spread over the plain, darting upon the
stragglers and wounded of the British Cavalry who came within their
reach; and, at the same time, giving confidence to such of their own
scattered Infantry as were still retreating in disorder and confusion.</p>

<p>At length, the Support so greatly needed by <span class="smcap">Ponsonby</span>'s Brigade
arrived upon its Left Flank. <span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span>, having passed the
hollow way and ravine which intercepted his progress towards the scene
of action, had reached that part of the crest of the position occupied
by <span class="smcap">Best</span>'s Hanoverian Brigade, through which it now advanced
to the front in Open Column of divisions. The 12th Light Dragoons,
being the leading Regiment, moved quickly down the slope: the 16th
Regiment remained higher up the acclivity; while the 11th were drawn
up in reserve upon the brow of the hill. The 12th and 16th wheeled
into Line to their right. Lieutenant Colonel the Hon. <span class="smcap">Frederick
Ponsonby</span>, who commanded the 12th, perceiving the confusion that
prevailed amidst the French Infantry in the valley, as also the
extremely critical situation of a great number of scattered red coated
Dragoons nearly on the crest of the French position, instantly charged
a mass of unsteady Infantry which intervened between him and these
Dragoons. This Infantry comprised the rearmost supporting Column of
<span class="smcap">Marcognet</span>'s Division, and was the only one of the attacking
Columns yet intact. It was now destined to share their fate. Already
alarmed by the disorder into which the entire of the Infantry on its
left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span> had been thrown, and now attacked so suddenly and unexpectedly on
its right, it was penetrated by the charge of the 12th.</p>

<p>These Dragoons having forced their way through the Column, whereby
their order was naturally much broken, came upon the Right Flank
of the Lancers who were in pursuit of <span class="smcap">Ponsonby</span>'s Brigade.
Quickening their speed, they dashed in amongst the French Cavalry,
and acting almost perpendicularly upon their Flank, they "rolled up"
such as were immediately in their front. The 16th Light Dragoons, with
<span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span> at their head, very gallantly charged obliquely upon
the front of the Lancers, whose further advance was completely checked
by this double attack. On their extreme Right, the 16th rather clashed
with some of the retiring Dragoons: but the two Regiments, carrying
every thing before them, succeeded in driving the French Light Cavalry
down again to the foot of the valley; which they had been ordered,
previously to their charge, not to pass.</p>

<p>Some few of both the 12th and 16th did, nevertheless, madly rush up the
opposite Height; where, by this time, fresh troops had arrived, who
made them suffer for their temerity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ghigny</span>'s Dutch-Belgian Light Cavalry Brigade, which had, at
the commencement of this Cavalry attack, crossed the Charleroi road,
came up, in the mean time, to the brow of the main position, on the
left of <span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span>'s Brigade. One of its Regiments, the 4th
Light Dragoons, went down the slope, following the 12th Light Dragoons;
and after experiencing the effects of a brisk fire which was kept up
by <span class="smcap">Durutte</span>'s Skirmishers from behind a bank and hedge, low
down the slope, and from which the 12th Light Dragoons had previously
suffered, it assisted in completing the dispersion of the French
Infantry. The other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span> Regiment (the 8th Hussars) remained a few minutes
upon the Height, and then advanced to draw off the retiring Cavalry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vivian</span>, who had come forward in person from the extreme Left,
and proceeded some way down the slope for the purpose of making his
observations, upon perceiving <span class="smcap">Ponsonby</span>'s Brigade charging in
disorder up the French Heights, immediately sent back word for the 10th
and 18th British Hussars to move through the hollow way to their right,
leaving the remaining Regiment of his Brigade, the 1st Hussars of the
King's German Legion, to keep a look out to the left. Very shortly
afterwards, two guns detached in advance from his Horse Battery, drew
up on the brow of the main ridge; but had scarcely opened a fire when
a well directed shot from one of the French Batteries passed through
the ammunition boxes of one of the limbers, causing an explosion, which
drew forth a shout of triumph on the part of the French Artillerymen.</p>

<p>The charge of <span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span>'s Brigade having succeeded, without
the active aid of even its own immediate Support, the 11th Light
Dragoons; the further advance of the 10th and 18th Hussars was not
required, but they continued in their new position, on the right of the
lane leading to Verd Cocou, and the two guns rejoined their Battery.</p>

<p>Major <span class="smcap">Whinyates</span>'s Rocket Troop, having been brought up to the
crest of the main ridge, from its previous position in reserve near
Mont St Jean, its Rocket Sections were moved down to the foot of the
exterior slope, whence they discharged several rockets at the French
troops then formed, or in the act of reforming, upon the opposite
heights. Immediately after the execution of this service, which was
gallantly and skilfully conducted, the Troop rejoined its guns on the
crest of the position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span></p>

<p>In the general <i>mêlée</i> which resulted from the charge of the British
Heavy Dragoons, and the overthrow of such masses of Infantry, augmented
as it was by the subsequent charges of, firstly, the French Lancers,
and, then, the two Regiments of British Light Cavalry, severe losses
were sustained on both sides; and the British Army was deprived of some
of its brightest ornaments.</p>

<p>The gallant Leader of the "Union Brigade," when endeavouring to return
to the Allied position, after using the most strenuous but fruitless
exertions to restrain his men in their wild pursuit, and to withdraw
them from a contest in which they had already gained undying fame,
became a sacrifice to his chivalrous and patriotic zeal. Intercepted by
a party of the Lancers in the soft ground of a newly ploughed field,
out of which his exhausted steed had not the power to extricate itself,
he fell beneath their deadly thrusts. Sir <span class="smcap">William Ponsonby</span>
had highly distinguished himself as a Cavalry Officer in Spain; and,
independently of his merits as a soldier, which were justly appreciated
by the whole Service, his amiable disposition and private virtues
endeared him to all his brother Officers.</p>

<p>His equally gallant namesake, Colonel the Hon. <span class="smcap">Frederick
Ponsonby</span>, immediately after his brilliant charge with the 12th
Light Dragoons, first through a Column of Infantry, and then upon the
Right Flank of the Lancers, was endeavouring to withdraw his Regiment
from further pursuit, when he was disabled in both arms, and carried
by his horse up to the crest of the French position; where, receiving
a sabre cut, he was struck senseless to the ground; and it was very
generally supposed at the time that he had been left dead on the field.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Hay</span>, who commanded the 16th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span> Light
Dragoons, was desperately and dangerously wounded. Colonel
<span class="smcap">Hamilton</span>, the Commanding Officer of the Scots Greys, after
gallantly leading his Regiment through the Enemy's Columns, across the
valley, and up the opposite Heights, was last seen far in advance;
where it is presumed, from his never having again appeared, he fell in
the midst of the French lines, a sacrifice to his distinguished but
indiscreet valour. Colonel <span class="smcap">Fuller</span>, who commanded the 1st, or
King's, Dragoon Guards, was killed when pursuing the <i>Cuirassiers</i>:
he boldly led his Regiment up the French Height immediately upon the
Allied Left of the Charleroi road. In addition to the above mentioned,
the British Cavalry engaged in this affair sustained a very heavy loss
in both Officers and men.</p>

<p>With the exception of the bodies of the slain; of such of the wounded
as were too far from their respective Lines to be removed; of loose
horses, some wildly careering about, others quietly grazing, and many
staggering, plunging, or convulsively pawing the ground around them,
from the agony of their wounds; the arena of this terrible conflict,
which had ceased but a few minutes before, was now perfectly clear. The
retiring crowds of French Infantry had disappeared behind the foremost
ridge of their position, to collect and reform their scattered remnants.</p>

<p>The British Cavalry were similarly employed&mdash;<span class="smcap">Somerset</span>'s
Brigade on the right of the Charleroi road, near the Orchard of the
Farm of Mont St Jean; <span class="smcap">Ponsonby</span>'s on the opposite side of the
road, in rear of a coppice bordering the hollow below that Farm; and
<span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span>'s on the interior slope of the position, more to the
right than where it had been posted during the earlier part of the day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pack</span>'s and <span class="smcap">Best</span>'s Brigades closed to their right upon
<span class="smcap">Kempt</span>'s, so as to fill up the interval occasioned by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
retreat of <span class="smcap">Bylandt</span>'s Dutch-Belgian Brigade; and the Knoll in
front of <span class="smcap">Kempt</span>'s Brigade was again occupied by three Companies
of the 95th Regiment; as was also the Farm of La Haye Sainte by the 2nd
Light Battalion King's German Legion, reinforced by two Companies of
the 1st Light Battalion of that Corps.</p>

<p>Major General Sir <span class="smcap">John Lambert</span>'s Infantry Brigade, which
had been kept in reserve near Mont St Jean, was put in motion at the
time <span class="smcap">Ponsonby</span>'s Dragoons advanced to the charge; and it was
now placed on the left of the Charleroi road, in Column, at quarter
distance, in rear and in support of the Fifth Division.</p>

<p>The importance of the result of this signal defeat of the French
attack was fully commensurate with the glory by which its achievement
was distinguished. The object of that attack, which was to force the
Centre and Left Wing of the Anglo-Allied Army and to establish a very
considerable body of troops in the vicinity of Mont St Jean, was
completely frustrated: 3,000 prisoners were taken; two Eagles were
captured; and between thirty and forty pieces of cannon were put <i>hors
de combat</i> for the greater part of the remainder of the day.</p>

<p>Thus terminated one of the grandest scenes which distinguished the
mighty drama enacted on the ever memorable plains of Waterloo; a
scene presenting in bold relief, genuine British valour crowned with
resplendent triumph; a scene, which should be indelibly impressed upon
the minds as well of living British warriors as of their successors in
ages yet unborn.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<blockquote>

<p>Britons! before other scenes are disclosed to your view, take one
retrospective glance at this glorious, this instructive, spectacle.
Let your imagination carry you to the rear of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span> that celebrated
position, and a little to the left of the Charleroi road. Behold, in
the foreground, on the right, a British Line of Cavalry advancing
to the charge, exulting in the consciousness of its innate courage,
indomitable spirit, and strength of arm. Whilst you are admiring the
beautiful order and perfect steadiness of their advance, your eyes are
suddenly attracted by the glittering splendour of a Line of horsemen
in burnished coats of mail, rising above the brow, and now crowning
the summit of the ridge. They are the far famed <i>Cuirassiers</i> of
France, led on by a <span class="smcap">Kellermann</span>; gallant spirits that have
hitherto overcome the finest troops that could be brought against
them, and have grown grey in glory. Trumpets sound the charge; in
the next instant your ears catch the low thundering noise of their
horses' hoofs, and your breathless excitement is wound to the highest
pitch as the adverse Lines clash together with a shock which, at the
moment, you expect must end in their mutual annihilation. Observe the
British, how they seem to doubt, for a second, in what manner to deal
with their opponents. Now they urge their powerful steeds into the
intervals between the necks of those of the <i>Cuirassiers</i>. Swords,
brandished high in air, gleam fitfully in rapid succession throughout
the Lines, here clashing together, there clanging against helmets and
cuirass which ring under their redoubled strokes. See! the struggle
is but a moment doubtful&mdash;the <i>Cuirassiers</i>, seemingly encumbered by
their coats of mail, are yielding to superior strength, dexterity, and
bravery combined&mdash;men and horses reel and stagger to the earth&mdash;gaps
open out in their Line&mdash;numbers are backing out&mdash;others are fairly
turning round&mdash;their whole Line now bends, and breaks asunder into
fragments&mdash;in the next moment they appear, as if by a miracle, to be
swept from off the crest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span> position, and being closely and hotly
pursued by the victors, the whole rushing down the other side of the
ridge, are snatched from your view.</p>

<p>Your attention is now irresistibly drawn to that part of the
foreground immediately facing you; where you have barely time to
catch sight of a Line of British Infantry just as it forces its way
through the hedge that runs along the crest of the ridge, to charge
a Column advancing up the other side. At the moment the shouts that
proclaim its triumph reach your ear, you are struck by the majestic
advance, close to your left, of another Line of British horsemen.
These halt just under the brow of the ridge. In their Left Front your
eye now also embraces a Line of British Infantry; whilst at the same
time you see the heads of two hostile Columns, issuing through the
hedge, and crowning the ridge amidst shouts of "<i>Vive l'Empereur!</i>"
The one nearest to you, finding no immediate opposition to its further
advance, is rapidly establishing itself on the Height: the other is
instantly met by a small but daring band of Scotch Highlanders. A
struggle ensues; the furthest Column is concealed from your view by
the smoke in which it is suddenly enshrouded; but at the very moment
when doubts arise in your mind as to the result, the Cavalry rushes
forward, and, passing through intervals opened out for it by the
Infantry, which immediately follows in pursuit, charges both these
heads of Columns, cutting them up, as it were, root and branch; and
then bounding through the hedge, the whole disappear as if by magic.
Now let your imagination, keeping pace with the intensity of feeling
excited by such a scene, carry you up to the summit of the ridge.</p>

<p>Behold, at once, the glorious spectacle spread out before you! The
Dragoons are in the midst of the Enemy's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span> Columns&mdash;the furious
impetuosity of their onslaught overcomes all resistance&mdash;the terror
stricken masses, paralyzed by this sudden apparition of Cavalry
amongst them, have neither time nor resolution to form Squares, and
limit their defence to a feeble, hasty, straggling fire from their
ill cemented edges&mdash;a flight, commencing from the rearmost ranks,
is rapidly augmented by the outward scattering occasioned by the
continually increasing pressure upon the front&mdash;the entire slope is
soon covered with the dispersed elements of the previously attacking
force&mdash;parties of Infantry are hurrying over the brow of the ridge to
aid others of the Cavalry in securing the prisoners&mdash;3,000 of these
are swept to the rear, and two Eagles are gloriously captured.</p>

<p>From the momentary contemplation of these trophies, your eyes
instinctively revert to the course of the victors, whom you now
perceive in the middle distance of the view&mdash;a broken Line of daring
horsemen, rushing up the opposite Heights. Their intoxicating
triumph admits of no restraint. They heed not the trumpet's call to
halt and rally; but plunging wildly amidst the formidable Line of
Batteries ranged along the French position, they commence sabring the
Gunners, stabbing the horses, and seem to clear the ground of every
living being. But physical efforts, however powerfully developed and
sustained, have their limit: exhausted nature yields at length; and
their fiery steeds, subdued, not by force but by exhaustion, retire
with lagging faltering pace. You look in vain for a Support&mdash;there is
none&mdash;but your eye is suddenly caught by the fluttering lance flags of
a Column of the Enemy's Cavalry, approaching from the left, and you
become nervously alive to the danger that awaits the valiant band of
heroes, who are only now made sensible of the necessity of retiring
to collect and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span> rally their scattered numbers. Seeing no Support
ready to receive them, and becoming aware of the near approach of
hostile Cavalry, they make a last and desperate effort. Those who are
best mounted, and whose horses are least blown, succeed in regaining
the Allied position unmolested; but a very considerable number are
overtaken by the Lancers, with whom they now contend under a fearful
disadvantage in point of speed and order.</p>

<p>But mark! a rescue is at hand&mdash;a gallant line of friendly Cavalry
throws itself against the Right Flank of the Lancers, the further
portion, or Left, of that Line first dashing through and scattering an
unsteady mass of Infantry, the sole remaining Column out of the entire
attacking force that has yet kept together. The tide of destruction
now sets in strongly against the Lancers. Their pursuit is checked.
The Heavy Dragoons are relieved from the pressure. A <i>mêlée</i> ensues;
but you are not kept long in suspense; for in another moment this
newly arrived force, making good its way, succeeds in driving the
Lancers in confusion down to the foot of the valley. The arena in your
front is speedily cleared of both friends and foes&mdash;the discharge of
rockets, which now attracts your attention, appears like a display
of fireworks in celebration of the glorious triumph&mdash;the affair has
terminated.</p>

<p>But stay to witness the concluding part of the scene. Observe
the splendidly attired group entering upon the right, just above
La Haye Sainte. It is headed by one whom you cannot for a moment
mistake&mdash;the illustrious <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>. Lord <span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span>,
returning from his brilliant charge, now joins the Duke, while the
whole <i>Corps Diplomatique et Militaire</i> express in the strongest
terms their admiration of the grand military spectacle of which
they have been spectators. Among them are representatives of nearly
all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span> the continental nations, so that this glorious triumph of
your valiant countrymen may be said to have been achieved in the
face of congregated Europe. Honour, imperishable honour, to every
British soldier engaged in that never to be forgotten fight! When
Britain again puts forth her strength in battle, may her Sovereign's
Guards inherit the same heroic spirit which animated those of
<span class="smcap">George</span>, Prince Regent, and inspire them with the desire
to maintain in all their pristine purity and freshness the laurels
transmitted to them from the Field of Waterloo; and when the soldiers
of the three United Kingdoms shall again be found fighting side by
side against the common Enemy, may they prove to the world that they
have not degenerated from the men of the "Union Brigade,"<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> who by
their heroic deeds on that great day, so faithfully represented the
military virtues of the British Empire!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>

<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> The Dutch-Belgians having been posted in Line on the
exterior slope, where, from the circumstance of their having been the
only Troops of the Anglo-Allied Left Wing so distinctly visible to the
Enemy, they became exposed in an especial manner to the destructive
effects of the formidable array of French Batteries, which continued
playing over the heads of the attacking columns. The losses of
<span class="smcap">Bylandt</span>'s Brigade on the 16th had already thinned, and in
a measure disorganised, its ranks; but those which it suffered on
this occasion were terrific, and the numerous gaps that so rapidly
presented themselves along the Line, as well as the number of superior
Officers that were observed to fall, could scarcely fail to produce a
prejudicial effect among these raw troops. Their confidence in their
own power of resistance had also been very considerably shaken, by the
circumstance of their having been deployed in a two-deep Line; instead
of having been allowed to assume the three-deep formation to which they
had previously been accustomed. In this affair, <span class="smcap">Perponcher</span>
had two horses shot under him. <span class="smcap">Bylandt</span> was wounded, as were
also Colonel <span class="smcap">Van Zuylen van Nyefelt</span>, Lieutenant Colonel
<span class="smcap">Westenberg</span> who commanded the 5th Battalion of Dutch Militia,
and several other Officers.
</p>
<p>
Had the British soldiers been fully aware of all these circumstances,
their feelings would assuredly not have been so greatly roused against
the Dutch-Belgians as they were on this particular occasion. But they
had neither time nor opportunity for reflection. They only saw the
hurried and confused retreat; and this, at such a moment, would have
equally exasperated them, had the troops so retiring been British.
</p>
<p>
That <span class="smcap">Picton</span>, who could perceive all that was passing along
the exterior slope, should have given vent to his irritation in the
remark he made to Captain <span class="smcap">Tyler</span>, is more surprising; but it
must be borne in mind, that his habitual reliance upon his own British
infantry, with which he felt that he could attempt anything, usually
led him to make but little allowance for the failure or discomfiture of
troops in general under almost any circumstances.</p></div>

<p class="drop">MUCH as the attention of both Commanders had been absorbed by the
contest described in the last Chapter, the attack and defence of
Hougomont had nevertheless been renewed and maintained with unabated
vigour.</p>

<p>The assailants, who continued in possession of the Wood, having been
strengthened by powerful reinforcements from both <span class="smcap">Jerome</span>'s and
<span class="smcap">Foy</span>'s Divisions, now opened so rapid and indiscriminate a fire
upon the Garden Wall that it might almost be supposed they entertained
the hope of battering it down with their shower of bullets. They failed
to make any impression upon the little garrison; though they obtained
partial successes on the Flanks, which again were counteracted on the
part of the defenders by the aid of Detachments from the main body of
<span class="smcap">Byng</span>'s Brigade of Guards, as also by the natural advantages
of the localities. Thus, upon the right, a retreat of the Guards from
the hedge which lines the Avenue and road leading to the Château, if
followed up by the French, would draw upon the latter a murderous fire
from the banks, brushwood, and other cover, in rear of the Avenue,
together with a flank fire from behind the Buildings: and, upon the
left, if they succeeded in forcing back the defenders from the front
to the rear hedge of the Orchard, their Left Flank became exposed to
a severe fire from the troops lining the eastern Garden Wall, while
they suffered at the same time from the new fire directed against their
front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span> by the retreating party, formed under cover of the hollow way by
which that rear hedge is bounded.</p>

<p>It was about two o'clock when <span class="smcap">Byng</span>, perceiving the increased
pressure upon the troops in the Orchard, and the great diminution which
had taken place in their numbers, desired Colonel <span class="smcap">Hepburn</span>,
who commanded the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Foot Guards, to move down
the slope with the remainder of his men as a reinforcement. Colonel
<span class="smcap">Hepburn</span> on reaching the hollow way found it occupied by Lord
<span class="smcap">Saltoun</span> with a very small force; and his Lordship having
scarcely a man remaining of his own Battalion, gave over to the Colonel
the command of that part of Hougomont, and rejoined <span class="smcap">Maitland</span>'s
Brigade.</p>

<p>After a short time, <span class="smcap">Hepburn</span> and his Battalion made a sudden
and vigorous rush into the Great Orchard from the hollow way in its
rear. The French Skirmishers gave way; and, as they crowded together
while retreating through the gap that leads into the Wood, they
suffered severely from the concentrated fire poured upon them by the
Guards; who quickly established themselves along the front hedge of the
Orchard.</p>

<p>This happened nearly at the same time in which the French were
repulsed in their grand attack upon the Centre and Left of the Duke of
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Line. It might be about half past two o'clock.</p>

<p>The Battle was then limited to a general cannonade, the roar of which
was incessant; and its effects, now that the range on both sides had
been very accurately obtained, were most galling and destructive to the
troops posted along the interior slope of either position.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alten</span>'s Light Troops again spread themselves out to the front
as soon as <span class="smcap">Kellermann</span>'s <i>Cuirassiers</i> had been swept from
off the exterior slope of the Anglo-Allied position.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span> They had not
been out long before their attention was directed to a heavy Column of
Infantry, apparently advancing from the vicinity of La Belle Alliance
towards La Haye Sainte. It was <span class="smcap">Bachelu</span>'s Division, which had
fallen back a little after the failure of <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s attack, to
which it had acted as a Reserve. Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Vigoureux</span>,
of the 30th British Regiment, who commanded these Light Troops of
<span class="smcap">Alten</span>'s Division, immediately threw them forward to meet the
Column. They poured a well concentrated and most galling fire upon the
mass; which immediately brought its right shoulders forward, and took
the direction of Hougomont, either in consequence of that fire, or in
accordance with Orders previously given.</p>

<p>The ground over which it wound its course descended sufficiently
to render the movement indistinct to the British Batteries on the
position; but the circumstance having been communicated to Captain
<span class="smcap">Cleeves</span>, whose Foot Battery of the King's German Legion
was posted on the most commanding point of the ridge on the right
of the Charleroi road, this Officer lost not a moment in making his
arrangements. He permitted the Column to continue its march unmolested
until it reached a point immediately in his front, on which he had
directed his guns so as to concentrate upon the mass, at the proper
moment, the whole fire of his Battery. The Column continued its march,
and had cleared more than two-thirds of the distance between La Belle
Alliance and Hougomont, when, having well entered within Captain
<span class="smcap">Cleeves</span>'s line of fire, three rounds from each gun were thrown
into it with astonishing rapidity, and awful effect. In a moment the
greater portion of the Column appeared to be dispersed, and flying back
in confusion towards the lower ground for shelter; leaving an immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
number of dead and dying to attest the fatal accuracy of the fire from
the Battery.</p>

<p>As no hostile force of either Cavalry or Infantry appeared in its
immediate vicinity, <span class="smcap">Bachelu</span> soon succeeded in rallying his
Division and renewing the advance. A similar result followed; whereupon
all further attempt to effect the contemplated movement was abandoned:
and thus a most serious flank attack upon Hougomont was completely
frustrated by the skilfully managed fire of a single Battery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bachelu</span> now took post again, upon the right of <span class="smcap">Foy</span>,
leaving a considerable interval between his Division and the Charleroi
road.</p>

<p>Foiled in his varied and repeated attacks upon Hougomont,
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> had now recourse to incendiary projectiles. For this
purpose he had ordered a Battery of Howitzers to be formed, from which
shells were thrown so as to descend into the Buildings. The Great Barn,
the outhouses on the north side of the Château, the Farmer's House, and
finally the Château itself, were speedily set on fire. Dense volumes
of smoke, enveloping the whole Post and its defenders, were wafted
slowly towards the Anglo-Allied Line; the roofs of the Buildings soon
fell in; and, shortly before three o'clock, the flames burst forth
with great brilliancy. Many of the wounded had been carried, or had
crawled, into the Buildings; but although their comrades entertained
the most distressing apprehensions for their safety, the stern sense
of duty and of honour prescribed that of the Post itself as paramount
to every other consideration. Invested as the place was by an Enemy so
overwhelmingly superior in numbers, and so unceasingly on the alert to
seize upon any advantage that might offer; not a man could be spared
to assist in extricating the sufferers from their perilous situation.
Obedience to the natural dictates of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span> humanity was necessarily
sacrificed to that which was due to the severe demands of discipline.
Thus several perished in the flames.</p>

<p>Others, who had contrived to crawl into the open Courts, could scarcely
breathe in the scorching and suffocating atmosphere. Many who had
sought shelter, or had been laid, in the Chapel, and whose terrors
were excited as they heard the crashing fall of burning timbers, or
the frequent explosion of shells around them, at length beheld the
flames penetrating the door of the sanctuary. The prayers that had been
fervently, though silently, offered up from that holy place, had surely
been accepted&mdash;the fire, reaching the feet of the wooden image of the
Saviour of Mankind, that stood above the entrance, seemed to feel the
sacred presence; for here its progress terminated; and this, without
the aid of human efforts.</p>

<p>The conflagration did not occasion a moment's relaxation in the
heroic exertions of the brave defenders of Hougomont. The courage and
devotedness of the men kept pace with the zeal and intelligence of
their Officers; and no sooner did new difficulties arise than they were
met and overcome by the most judicious arrangements, combined with the
most consummate gallantry.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was now about half past three o'clock. The Anglo-Allied Line
continued compact and unshaken in its original position. Its Advanced
Posts of La Haye Sainte and Hougomont had successfully resisted the
most formidable assaults.</p>

<p>The Left Wing had sustained considerable loss in meeting and repelling
the French Right Wing, but the losses endured by the latter in that
attack were infinitely more severe: whole Columns of Infantry had been
completely overthrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span> and dispersed; Squadrons of the most splendid
and most devoted Cavalry had shared a similar fate; whilst from
thirty to forty pieces of cannon had been rendered useless for nearly
the remainder of the day. Hence, the French Emperor did not deem it
advisable to renew, at least so soon, an attack upon the Left of the
Anglo-Allied Army. He decided on forming a grand attack upon its Right
and Centre: and since <span class="smcap">Reille</span>'s Infantry had already suffered
very considerably in its assaults upon Hougomont, he determined upon
employing his Cavalry for that purpose; more especially as the ground
in front of that part of the Allied Line appeared well adapted for the
movements of this description of force.</p>

<p>To gain possession of La Haye Sainte and Hougomont, as a preliminary
step, was undoubtedly the most judicious course: but hitherto his
endeavours to obtain that vantage ground had altogether failed, and
he was now compelled to limit his plan; combining with the projected
attack, renewed assaults against those Posts; which, even if again
unsuccessful, would at least serve to divert in some degree, the
Enemy's attention.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> also contemplated a more important diversion, by
causing a demonstration to be made with <span class="smcap">Piré</span>'s Light Cavalry
against <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Right Flank.</p>

<p>In pursuance of this plan, renewed efforts were made by the attacking
force against Hougomont; and two Columns from <span class="smcap">Donzelot</span>'s
Division descended upon La Haye Sainte.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Major <span class="smcap">Baring</span> having applied for a reinforcement,
two Companies were detached to his Post from the 1st Light Battalion
of the King's German Legion. To these and a part of his own Battalion,
he intrusted the defence of the Garden; and, abandoning altogether
the Orchard, he placed the remainder of his force in the Buildings,
distribut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>ing their defence among the three Officers who had so
courageously maintained them during the previous attack.</p>

<p>The French Columns advanced against this Post with the most undaunted
resolution and the most conspicuous gallantry. The well aimed bullets
of the German rifles, though they told quickly and fearfully amidst
their masses, arrested not their progress for a moment. They rushed
close up to the walls; and, seizing the rifles as they protruded
through the loop holes, endeavoured to wrest them from the hands of the
defenders. They also made a most furious assault against the gates and
doors, in defence of which many lives were sacrificed. The greatest
struggle was at the western opening to the Large Barn, the door of
which was wanting. The French, determined to make good an entrance,
encountered the brave Germans equally resolute to prevent them. The
foremost Frenchmen, dashing boldly on to force their way, were struck
down by the deliberate fire from the rifles the instant they reached
the threshold; and seventeen of their dead bodies already formed a
rampart for those who continued to press forward to carry on the
struggle.</p>

<p>It was nearly four o'clock when certain movements made by the Lancers
on the French extreme Left, led the Duke to suspect an attack from
that quarter; and which, considering the almost isolated position of
his detached force at Braine l'Alleud and Vieux Foriez, might, if
successful, be attended with very serious consequences to himself. He
drew Lord <span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span>'s attention to that point; and the latter
immediately despatched <span class="smcap">Grant</span>, with the 13th Light Dragoons and
the 15th Hussars of his Brigade to attack the Lancers, detaching at
the same time the 2nd Light Dragoons of the King's German Legion from
<span class="smcap">Dörnberg</span>'s Brigade, towards Braine l'Alleud, for the purpose
both of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span> facilitating the attack, by man&oelig;uvring on the left of the
Lancers, and of watching the Enemy's dispositions in that direction.</p>

<p>The fire of Artillery along both Lines had been maintained with the
utmost vigour. At this moment, however, a most furious cannonade was
directed against that part of the Anglo-Allied Line which was situated
between the two high roads. While some of the French Light Batteries
took post in advance, others of the Imperial Guard, comprising twelve
pounders, opened a fire from the Heights in rear of, and above, La
Belle Alliance; and as the Batteries upon the main French Line were
ranged along the arc of the chord formed by the Allied Line, the French
Artillery was enabled by its very great numerical superiority in
guns to concentrate an overwhelming fire upon any part of the Duke's
position.</p>

<p>The Allied Infantry posted in Columns along the interior slope of the
ridge, were entirely screened from the observation of the French, who
could not distinguish any portion of their Enemies beyond the devoted
British and German Artillerymen at their guns; which, despite the
severity of the fire from their opponents, were worked with the most
admirable coolness and intrepidity, and with a precision beyond all
praise.</p>

<p>The thunder of the Artillery continued pealing forth in an
uninterrupted roll, and the scene became awfully grand. The guns having
once obtained the required range, were fired without intermission.
Instantaneous flashes met the eye, all along the Heights, succeeded
by volumes of smoke bounding forth along the ground in front, and
enveloping the Batteries in clouds. The earth trembled beneath the
dread concussion. The oldest soldiers had never witnessed a cannonade
conducted with such fury, with such desperation.</p>

<p class="caption">Ney</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span></p>

<p>The Allied Columns of Infantry were lying down upon the ground to
shelter themselves as much as possible from the iron shower that fell
fast and heavily&mdash;round shot, tearing frightful rents directly through
their masses, or ploughing up the earth beside them; shells, bursting
in the midst of the serried Columns, and scattering destruction in
their fall, or previously burying themselves in the soft loose soil to
be again forced upwards in eruptions of iron, mud, and stones, that
fell among them like volcanic fragments.</p>

<p>During this terrible conflict of Artillery, <span class="smcap">Ney</span> was making his
preparatory dispositions with the Cavalry which <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> had
desired him to launch against the Anglo-Allied Right Wing.</p>

<p>He first formed for attack, <span class="smcap">Milhaud</span>'s Corps of <i>Cuirassiers</i>,
consisting of twenty four Squadrons; and directed <span class="smcap">Lefèbvre
Desnouette</span>'s Light Cavalry Division of the Guard, comprising seven
Squadrons of Lancers and twelve Squadrons of <i>Chasseurs</i>, to follow
and support&mdash;in all forty three Squadrons&mdash;constituting a magnificent
array of gallant horsemen. As they began to advance, the First Line, of
<i>Cuirassiers</i>, shone in burnished steel, relieved by black horse hair
crested helmets; next came the Red Lancers of the Guard, in their gaudy
uniform, and mounted on richly caparisoned steeds, their fluttering
lance flags heightening the brilliancy of their display; whilst the
Third Line, comprising the <i>Chasseurs</i> of the Guard, in their rich
costume of green and gold, with fur trimmed pelisses <i>à la hussard</i>,
and black bearskin shakos, completed the gorgeous, yet harmonious,
colouring of this military spectacle. Though formed in successive Lines
of Columns in the hollow space on the immediate left of La Haye Sainte,
where they were sheltered in some degree from the cannonade that raged
so furiously above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span> them, the Rear Lines obliqued to the left on the
advance, and became <i>echelonned</i> to the First Line, so as to present a
general front extending from the Charleroi road on their right to the
Hougomont inclosures on their left.</p>

<p>As they ascended the ridge, the French Artillery suspended their fire;
and the Allied Batteries commenced pouring a destructive shower of
grape shot amidst their devoted ranks. Fiercely and fatally did this
iron hail rattle against the helmed and steel clad <i>Cuirassiers</i>,
here glancing off, there penetrating the armour; wounding or laying
prostrate many a gallant warrior at the very moment when the brightest
visions of glory had opened on his ardent imagination. This iron
sleet, however, caused no perceptible check to their progress; and,
with shouts of "<i>Vive l'Empereur!</i>" they accelerated their pace until,
having arrived within about forty yards of the guns, they received the
last and well prepared discharge. Its effects were terrific: but though
their order was somewhat broken, their courage was not shaken. The
charge was sounded; a cheer followed; and, in the next instant, they
rushed up to the very cannon's mouth.</p>

<p>In accordance with previous instructions given by the Duke of
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span> himself, the Artillerymen withdrew, upon the close
approach of the Cavalry, and sought shelter either beside, or in rear
of, the Infantry Squares; or, where occasion required, they threw
themselves under the projecting bayonets of the outer kneeling ranks
for protection. The <i>Cuirassiers</i>, on crowning the crest of the ridge;
and finding themselves so unexpectedly in possession of a Line of
Batteries, shouted loudly forth their triumph; and, then renewing their
onward charge, were, in a moment, lost to the view of the Lancers and
<i>Chasseurs</i> of the Guard. These troops, carried away by the enthusiasm
of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span> moment and the eager desire to share in the fancied victory,
advanced with the same fiery impetuosity, and the whole force was now
fairly across the ridge.</p>

<p>The Allied Infantry, distributed in chequered Squares along the
interior slope, were fully prepared to meet the attack. Some little
apprehension had been entertained for the safety of the Right of the
Front Line, where the Brunswickers, who, as before remarked, were
mostly young, raw troops, had taken up the ground previously occupied
by <span class="smcap">Byng</span>'s Brigade of Guards, which had been entirely absorbed
by the defence of Hougomont, with the exception of two Companies which,
with the Colours, had been withdrawn, as a Reserve, to a more sheltered
position on the right of the Nivelles road. As the French Cavalry
advanced, the 23rd British Regiment of Infantry was led up to the Front
Line, and into an interval between the Brunswick Squares. This Regiment
had nearly reached the brow of the ridge when it was suddenly ordered
to halt and prepare to receive Cavalry; and the <i>Chasseurs</i> of the
Guard appearing the next moment in its front, a fire from this face
was opened so hastily that scarcely a shot could have told upon the
Enemy. It instantly recovered this somewhat nervous precipitation, and
presented a bold and determined stand; as did also the Brunswickers,
who acted on this occasion in a manner that would have reflected credit
on the most experienced veterans.</p>

<p>The cannonade had necessarily ceased along the Right Wing of the
Anglo-Allied Front Line, and along the French Batteries to which it was
opposed. Hence the vehement cheering on the part of the French Cavalry
became the more distinctly audible and the more highly exciting. A
sullen silence was maintained throughout the Allied Squares, which were
all at the "prepare,"&mdash;front ranks kneeling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span> and the second at the
charge,&mdash;thus forming a <i>chevaux de frise</i>, over which the rear ranks
were ready to fire, as occasion might demand.</p>

<p>As the Cavalry now rushed down upon the Squares, the front faces of the
latter opened their fire when the former had approached within about
thirty paces of them. The effect of this fire was to create disorder
and confusion in the leading Squadron or Half Squadron (as the case
might be), which would then open out from the centre, and obliquing
to the right and left respectively, pass on by the Flanks of the
Square attacked, to the fire from which it would consequently become
completely exposed. The succeeding repeated the man&oelig;uvre of the
leading divisions; and their disorder became greater and greater as the
continually augmenting obstacles in their front, the upset riders and
horses, increased in multitude.</p>

<p>Here, as at Quatre Bras, the French Cavalry did not rush to the shock
against a single British Square. The horsemen of the leading divisions
who escaped the opposing fire, failed to maintain the direction of
their speed with unabated vigour, and to dash against the Square,
heedless of personal danger, and intent only upon securing the sole
chance that offered for the success of their immediate followers. That
portion of the Cavalry which passed through the intervals between
the foremost Squares, directed their advance upon those that were in
rear; and the Squares being generally <i>en échiquier</i>, the opening out
and dividing of the attacking Squadrons in the manner described, soon
commingled the horsemen of different Regiments, and added considerably
to the disorder already caused by the dropping fire which assailed them
in all directions.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Allied Cavalry, having the advantage of perfect order, now
advanced to the charge; and after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span> encountering some little resistance
on different points, speedily succeeded in relieving the Squares from
the presence of the Enemy, whom they pursued over the crest of the
ridge and down the exterior slope.</p>

<p>No sooner was <span class="smcap">Ney</span>'s Cavalry driven from the position, than
the Allied Artillerymen flew from their shelter to their guns, and the
French Batteries recommenced their fire. The former dealt destruction
amidst the retiring masses as soon as, and wherever, they were
uncovered by the Allied Cavalry; but some of the British Regiments,
giving too much rein to their ardour, carried their pursuit rather
too far; particularly the 23rd British Light Dragoons; who, having
attacked the Flank of a Column of <i>Cuirassiers</i> whilst the latter was
advancing against the 1st Regiment of Dutch Carabiniers, by which it
was then attacked in front&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trip</span> himself leading&mdash;drove both
the <i>Cuirassiers</i> and a body of Lancers across the hollow on the right
of La Haye Sainte, back upon their own Batteries on the Heights beyond,
and thus created confusion amongst the French Gunners; who, however,
made them pay for their temerity as they withdrew again towards their
own position.</p>

<p>Towards the Allied Right, the Lancers, pursued by the 1st Light
Dragoons of the King's German Legion, instantly reformed, and, resuming
their charge, became themselves the pursuers; but on advancing over
the ridge, they were not only exposed again to the fire from the
Squares, but were at the same time most unexpectedly assailed by a
brisk discharge of round shot from Captain <span class="smcap">Bolton</span>'s British
Foot Battery, which had just been rapidly advanced to its left front,
and very judiciously posted on some favourable ground close to, and on
the right of, the Nivelles road, and in direct rear of the main ridge.
Its fire was directed with great precision at the French Cavalry in
the intervals between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span> Squares in its front, and by its valuable
assistance the Enemy was soon compelled to retire again across the
ridge.</p>

<p>It will be readily conceived that such assistance was most essential,
when it is recollected that, at this time, the 7th Hussars, the 1st
Light Dragoons of the King's German Legion, the Brunswick Hussars, and
the Squadron of Brunswick Lancers, were the only Cavalry Regiments
posted in rear of that portion of the Front Line extending from the
Nivelles road on the right, to the position of <span class="smcap">Halkett</span>'s
British Infantry Brigade on the left, in rear of which latter stood
the 23rd Light Dragoons. The manner in which those Regiments charged
and repelled the French Cavalry opposed to them, merits the highest
commendation.</p>

<p>The French Cavalry evinced the greatest alacrity, nay, impatience,
in again getting into order&mdash;actuated, no doubt, by a sense of shame
and indignation at finding its efforts frustrated, and its valour
fruitless; although in possession of the Enemy's guns, and at liberty
to act at its own discretion against his Squares.</p>

<p>The advance was speedily renewed; but evidently conducted with more
caution, though not with less enthusiasm. Again did this brilliant
array of horsemen boldly face the iron shower of grape, and gallantly
crown the crest of the Anglo-Allied Right Wing. But now, instead of
attacking indiscriminately as before, one portion was allotted to that
service; whilst the remainder was kept in more compact order to stem
the onset of the Allied Cavalry, by which, on the former occasion,
they had been so signally repulsed. The charges were repeated against
the Squares, in the same style, and upon the same system, as before;
and with an equally fruitless result. This portion of the attacking
force became gradually exhausted and out of order: but the remainder
appeared well formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span> up, and moving forward to charge the Second
Line comprising Allied Cavalry; which, however, did not wait for the
attack, but instantly advanced to meet it. The latter consisted of
<span class="smcap">Somerset</span>'s Brigade on the left (greatly diminished by the
effects of its former charge, on the occasion of the French attack of
the Allied Left and Centre); of the 23rd British Light Dragoons, in
rear of <span class="smcap">Halkett</span>'s British Infantry Brigade; of <span class="smcap">Trip</span>'s
Dutch-Belgian Carabinier Brigade, in rear of the 23rd; of the Brunswick
Hussars and Lancers, more to the right; of the 1st Light Dragoons of
the King's German Legion, close to the Nivelles road; and of the 7th
British Hussars, on the interior slope of that portion of the ridge
which was immediately in left rear of Hougomont&mdash;a force scarcely
amounting to half the number of Squadrons with which the French Cavalry
had commenced this attack.</p>

<p>The charge was executed under great excitement, and with the utmost
steadiness and gallantry. The struggle was desperate and sanguinary:
but the French Cavalry, assailed in front by the same description of
force, and on their flanks by the fire from the Squares, at length
went about; and were followed, as before, over the ridge and down the
exterior slope.</p>

<p>In rear of the Right of the Anglo-Allied Line, where, as previously
observed, the Cavalry was then so very weak in numbers, the 1st Light
Dragoons of the King's German Legion had deployed into Line, in order
to occupy more ground and show a greater front. As the French Lancers
were attacking the Squares, and advancing through the intervals between
them, notwithstanding the renewed fire from <span class="smcap">Bolton</span>'s Battery,
the Regiment hastened forward to charge them.</p>

<p>The Germans had not proceeded far when it was discovered that a body
of the Enemy's Cavalry had penetrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span> to the open space on their
left. With great presence of mind and admirable promptitude, Major
<span class="smcap">Reizenstein</span>, who perceived the danger to which the Regiment
was exposed by the already meditated attack upon its Left Flank, drew
off a great part of it, and, with a right-shoulder-forward movement,
advanced to meet these new assailants who were now coming on at full
speed. The mutual impetuosity of the charge, and violence of the shock,
were terrific. The two Lines dashed at and through each other, and
those of the horsemen that were yet firm in their saddles, wheeling
sharply round, again rushed to the fierce encounter with the most
resolute bravery; and the dispersed riders, after rapidly exchanging
cuts and thrusts, <i>en passant</i>, sought out their respective Corps.</p>

<p>As the Cavalry retired, the Infantry that had attacked La Haye Sainte
desisted from their fruitless endeavours to force the gallant little
garrison. Not long afterwards, Major <span class="smcap">Baring</span>, on finding that
the ammunition of his men had, by the constant firing, been reduced
to less than one half, became apprehensive of its speedy exhaustion;
and despatched an Officer to request a supply, which was promised to
him. In the mean time, the Germans set about diligently repairing the
injuries they had sustained, and making the best preparation in their
power to meet the next attack.</p>

<p>Upon the first advance of the French Cavalry, by the Allied left of
Hougomont, a body of Infantry Skirmishers crept along the boundary
hedge of the Great Orchard on that side, and by thus turning the Flank
of the 3rd Guards, who were at the same time assailed with renewed
vigour in front, compelled them to retire into the hollow way in rear
of the inclosure; but, as the Cavalry withdrew, so did the Light Troops
on the left of the Orchard, and Lieutenant Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span> <span class="smcap">Hepburn</span>,
advancing his men from their cover, drove back the French Skirmishers
in the Orchard, and again occupied its front hedge.</p>

<p>The contest at this time, between the Allied Left, and the French
Right, Wing was limited to a continued cannonade, with Light Troops
skirmishing in the valley which separated the two positions. The Nassau
troops, under Prince <span class="smcap">Bernhard</span> of Saxe Weimar, maintained their
ground with great spirit along the Villages and inclosures upon the
extreme Left of the Anglo-Allied Army.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grant</span>, who, it will be recollected, had been detached with
the 13th Light Dragoons and the 15th Hussars, to attack the 5th and
6th French Lancers, upon the extreme Left of the French Line, in
consequence of certain menacing dispositions on their part, was first
made aware that these had been merely a diversion to draw off a portion
of the Allied Cavalry from the real point of attack, by the shouts
which suddenly proceeded from their ranks; when, on turning round to
ascertain the cause, he perceived the French in possession of the
Batteries along the crest of the position, and charging the Squares
posted on the interior slope. Observing a repetition of the attack,
and the want of Cavalry on that part of the position which he had
quitted; he most judiciously took upon himself to return to it with
both Regiments: and, as will appear in the sequel, he arrived there at
a most critical moment, when his absence might have produced the most
fatal consequences. As a precautionary measure, the Right Squadron of
the 15th Hussars, under Captain <span class="smcap">Wodehouse</span>, was left in its
original position, to observe the extreme Left of the French line; and
the 2nd Light Dragoons of the King's German Legion continued to keep a
look out between that point and Braine l'Alleud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, perceiving the necessity of affording an immediate
Support to <span class="smcap">Ney</span>'s attack, sent an Order to <span class="smcap">Kellermann</span>
to advance for that purpose, with his Corps of Heavy Cavalry,
consisting of the two Divisions commanded by <span class="smcap">L'Heritier</span> and
<span class="smcap">Roussel d'Urbal</span>, and comprising (at the commencement of the
Battle) seven Squadrons of Dragoons, eleven Squadrons of <i>Cuirassiers</i>,
and six Squadrons of Carabiniers. In the mean time, <span class="smcap">Ney</span>,
with a similar object in view, had ordered forward <span class="smcap">Guyot</span>'s
Heavy Cavalry Division of the Guard, comprising six Squadrons of
Horse Grenadiers, and seven Squadrons of Dragoons. These thirty-seven
Squadrons, combined with the force which had already attacked, and
which had originally consisted of forty-three Squadrons, constituted
a stupendous array of Cavalry, in comparison with that which was then
posted in rear of the Right Wing of the Anglo-Allied Army; and which
received no accession beyond the five Squadrons that <span class="smcap">Grant</span> was
in the act of withdrawing, as before explained, from the extreme Right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Guyot</span>'s Division of the Guard having been placed by
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> at <span class="smcap">Ney</span>'s disposal, when he first desired him
to form the grand Cavalry attack, the Marshal was entitled to employ
it if he thought proper; but it is doubtful whether <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>,
after having sent forward <span class="smcap">Kellermann</span>'s Corps, was desirous
that the combined force should be thus prematurely engaged, since it
would deprive him of his only Cavalry Reserve. Still, when we consider
the limited extent of the Field of Battle, and the consequent facility
with which he might have either suspended the employment of the Heavy
Cavalry of the Guard, or countermanded <span class="smcap">Kellermann</span>'s advance,
it is reasonable to infer that the French Emperor was not altogether
displeased with the grand experiment which was about to be made, and
which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span> encouraged the most sanguine expectations of a glorious triumph.</p>

<p>The coming attack was, like the former one, preceded by a violent
cannonade. As before, the French Batteries concentrated their fire upon
the Allied Artillery and Squares. The entire space immediately in rear
of the crest of the ridge that marked the Front Line of the Duke's
Right Wing, was again assailed with a tempest of shot and shell. Again
were whole Files torn away, and compact Sections rent asunder.</p>

<p>But the extraordinary skill and the untiring energies of the British
and German Gunners, combined with the heroic forbearance and the
admirable steadiness of the Squares, fully impressed upon the mind
of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> the conviction that, however formidable and
disproportionate the force that his powerful adversary could wield
against him, it might yet be made to suffer an exhaustion, moral as
well as physical, that would render it totally unavailable and helpless
at the moment when its extremest tension and fullest application would
be so urgently required to extricate the Emperor from that perilous
crisis which, by his Grace's masterly arrangements, was gradually
approaching its consummation. To act exclusively on the defensive, to
maintain his ground in defiance of every assault and every stratagem;
and yet to harass and weaken his Enemy to the extent of his power,
constituted the grand point on which hinged the practical development
of those arrangements. A defeat and dispersion of his Army before
the arrival of the Prussian troops, would lead to new measures,
to additional sacrifices&mdash;perhaps to irretrievable disasters. But
his resolve was fixed and irrevocable; for he knew that he could
fearlessly rely upon the devotion, the endurance, and the valour of
his British and German soldiers. And this implicit confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span> was
nobly reciprocated; for as the troops remarked the serenity of his
countenance and demeanour when rectifying any confusion or disorder, or
felt as if spellbound by the magic influence of a few simple and homely
words from his lips, they entertained no doubts as to the result of
their glorious exertions.</p>

<p>When the tremendous Cavalry force, which <span class="smcap">Ney</span> had thus
assembled, moved forward to the attack, the whole space between La Haye
Sainte and Hougomont appeared one moving glittering mass; and, as it
approached the Anglo-Allied position, undulating with the conformation
of the ground, it resembled a sea in agitation. Upon reaching the crest
of the ridge and regaining temporary possession of the Batteries,
its very shouts sounded on the distant ear like the ominous roar
of breakers thundering on the shore. Like waves following in quick
succession, the whole mass now appeared to roll over the ridge; and as
the light curling smoke arose from the fire which was opened by the
Squares, and by which the latter sought to stem the current of the
advancing host, it resembled the foam and spray thrown up by the mighty
waters as they dash on isolated rocks and beetling crags; and, as the
mass separated and rushed in every direction, completely covering
the interior slope, it bore the appearance of innumerable eddies and
counter currents, threatening to overwhelm and engulf the obstructions
by which its onward course had been opposed. The storm continued to
rage with the greatest violence; and the devoted Squares seemed lost in
the midst of the tumultuous onset. In vain did the maddening mass chafe
and fret away its strength against these impregnable barriers; which,
based upon the sacred principles of honour, discipline, and duty, and
cemented by the ties of patriotism and the impulse of national glory,
stood proudly unmoved and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span> inaccessible. Disorder and confusion,
produced by the commingling of Corps, and by the scattering fire from
the faces of the chequered Squares, gradually led to the retreat of
parties of horsemen across the ridge; these were followed by broken
Squadrons, and, at length, the retrograde movement became general.</p>

<p>Then the Allied Dragoons, who had been judiciously kept in readiness
to act at the favourable moment, darted forward to complete the
disorganisation and overthrow of the now receding waves of the French
Cavalry.</p>

<p>The Allied Artillery had barely time to fire a few rounds into the
retiring masses, when the Enemy's formidable Support rapidly advanced
to renew the attack; and, as if it had been made aware that the Right
of the Anglo-Allied Line was the weakest part, from the want of a
sufficient Cavalry Support, its efforts appeared particularly directed
to that point. A body of Heavy Dragoons was drawn up in Line, and
advanced up the ridge leaving the Hougomont inclosures immediately on
its left.</p>

<p>At this moment, however, <span class="smcap">Grant</span> had most opportunely returned
with the 13th Light Dragoons and 15th Hussars from the extreme Right;
and instantly forming the 13th, which was the leading Regiment, in Line
to the front, moved it up to the crest of the ridge, over which it
gallantly charged and routed the French Dragoons, driving them about
three hundred yards down to the low ground near the north-east angle
of the Great Orchard of Hougomont. The 15th Hussars were also formed
to the front, on the left of the 13th Light Dragoons, and charged a
mass of <i>Cuirassiers</i>, which was driven back a like distance, upon
large bodies of Cavalry. As these were observed commencing offensive
operations, both in front and on the flank, the two Regiments, first
the 13th, and then the 15th; were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span> compelled to retreat to the main
position, and take post in rear of the Squares; but this they did with
so much order and regularity that their presence and example imparted
new life and confidence to the young Brunswickers; whose steadiness, on
the Right of the Line, had been severely tested in the course of the
grand Cavalry attack.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these reverses, and the decided failure of their former
attempts, the French horsemen most gallantly and resolutely renewed
their advance, and again plunged in masses amidst the Allied Squares.
Failing in their direct attack, they rode through the intervals between
the Squares in all directions, exhibiting extraordinary coolness and
intrepidity. Some of the most daring approached close up to the ranks,
to draw forth the fire from a Square; and thus secure a better chance
of success for the Squadron prepared to seize the advantage and to
charge. Small parties of desperate fellows would endeavour to force an
opening at some weak point, by cutting aside the bayonets and firing at
the defenders with their pistols. But the Squares were proof against
every assault and every stratagem.</p>

<p>More Cavalry crossed over the summit of the ridge; and the greater part
of the interior slope occupied by the Allied Right Wing seemed covered
with horsemen of all kinds&mdash;<i>Cuirassiers</i>, Lancers, Carabiniers,
<i>Chasseurs</i>, Dragoons, and Horse Grenadiers. The French, enraged at
their want of success, brandishing their swords, and exciting one
another by shouts of "<i>Vive l'Empereur!</i>" reiterated their attacks
with redoubled but fruitless vigour. Like the majestic oaks of the
forest, which are poetically said to strike their roots deeper and more
tenaciously into the earth as the fury of the storm increases, so stood
the Anglo-Allied Squares, grand in the imposing attitude of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span> their
strength, and bidding defiance to the tempestuous elements by which
they were assailed on every side.</p>

<p>At length, the attack evinced symptoms of exhaustion; the charges
became less frequent and less vigorous; disorder and confusion were
rapidly augmenting; the spirit of enthusiasm and the confidence of
superiority were quickly yielding to the feeling of despondency and
the sense of hopelessness. The Anglo-Allied Cavalry again advanced,
and once more swept the mingled host, comprising every description of
mounted troops, from off the ground on which they had so fruitlessly
frittered away their strength.</p>

<p>On this occasion, a body of <i>Cuirassiers</i>, having been intercepted in
its direct line of retreat by a party of British Light Dragoons, was
induced to surrender; but taking advantage of the weakness of their
escort, they suddenly broke away, and galloped down the Nivelles road,
by which they hoped to return to the French Lines. They were fatally
deceived. As they passed the high bank, covered with brushwood, on
the right of the road, where a Detachment of the 51st Regiment was
stationed as one of the Supports to the Light Troops extended in front
of the extreme Right, they were fired upon, though but partially,
in consequence of their close pursuit by the Light Dragoons. This
attracted the attention of Captain Ross of that Regiment, who was
posted with his Company more in advance, and close to the <i>abatis</i>
which had been thrown across the road near the head of the Avenue
leading to Hougomont. Captain Ross, being thus prepared, also fired
upon the <i>Cuirassiers</i>; whereupon their Commanding Officer, finding
all further retreat effectually cut off by the <i>abatis</i>, surrendered
to Captain Ross, declaring that he would not give himself up to the
Dragoons. At this spot eighty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span> the <i>Cuirassiers</i> and twelve of their
horses were killed; and the remainder, about sixty, were dismounted,
taken, or dispersed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Shortly before this, <span class="smcap">Ney</span>, perceiving the ill success of his
Cavalry attacks, determined on combining them with such Infantry as he
had at his disposal. Between <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s and <span class="smcap">Reille</span>'s
Corps there was now a great interval, and the only troops of which he
could make use for the above object, consisted of <span class="smcap">Bachelu</span>'s
Division, on the right of the latter, as <span class="smcap">Donzelot</span>'s Division,
on the left of the former, was still required for the attack upon La
Haye Sainte, which he now ordered to be vigorously renewed, whilst he
advanced a heavy Column of <span class="smcap">Bachelu</span>'s Infantry towards the
Centre of the Allied Right Wing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, who had, from the first, anticipated that the
attacks of Cavalry would be followed up by others, in which that Arm
would be combined with Infantry, was fully prepared to meet this
contingency, having as soon as he had ascertained that the Enemy was
not disposed to attempt any serious movement against his Right Flank,
despatched an Order to <span class="smcap">Chassé</span> to evacuate Braine l'Alleud
and its vicinity, and to proceed with his Dutch-Belgian Division,
towards the principal scene of action, along the low ground through
Merbe Braine. By this means, his Grace, who contemplated reinforcing
his First Line with troops from his Second, would be enabled to
supply their place in the latter with others of equal strength.
<span class="smcap">Chassé</span>'s movement, executed with much judgement, was in a
great measure, if not entirely, concealed from the Enemy's observation;
and was very skilfully covered by the 2nd Light Dragoons of the King's
German Legion, who continued hovering near the Left Flank of the French
Army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span></p>

<p>In the mean time, the attack upon La Haye Sainte had been renewed
with the same fury as before. Major <span class="smcap">Baring</span> on perceiving the
advance of the Enemy's Columns, sent an Officer to the position with
this intelligence, and repeated his request for ammunition. The Light
Company of the 5th Line Battalion of the King's German Legion was sent
to his assistance; but the supply of ammunition, of which he stood so
much in need, was not forthcoming: and he therefore, after waiting half
an hour longer, during which the contest was uninterrupted, despatched
another Officer on the same errand. This application proved equally
unsuccessful. He received, however, a reinforcement of two Flank
Companies from the 1st Regiment of Nassau.</p>

<p>The great struggle was again at the open entrance to the Barn; and the
French, finding all their efforts to force an entrance so obstinately
and successfully frustrated, had recourse to the expedient of setting
the place on fire. A thick smoke was soon observed issuing from the
Barn. The greatest consternation pervaded the little garrison; for
although there was a pond in the yard, there were no means at hand for
conveying the water to the point of danger. Major <span class="smcap">Baring</span>,
whose anxiety was extreme, glancing his eye at the large camp kettles
borne by the recently arrived Nassauers, instantly pulled one from
off a man's back: several Officers followed his example, and filling
the kettles with water, carried them in the face of almost certain
death, to the fire. The men hesitated not a moment. Every kettle was
instantly applied to the same good office, and the fire was fortunately
extinguished; though at the sacrifice of many a brave soldier. Several
of the men, although covered with wounds, rejected all persuasion to
retire. Their constant reply was, "So long as our Officers fight, and
we can stand, we will not stir from the spot." At length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span> the Enemy,
wearied out by this most resolute and gallant defence, once more
withdrew.</p>

<p>At the commencement of this attack, while one portion of the Enemy's
force was principally directed against the western entrance of the
Great Barn; the other, leaving the Buildings on its right, advanced
higher up the slope, as if intending either to penetrate the Farm by
the Garden, or to cut off its communication with the main position.</p>

<p>The Prince of <span class="smcap">Orange</span>, conceiving this to be a favourable
opportunity for attacking the French Column, ordered the 5th and 8th
Line Battalions of <span class="smcap">Ompteda</span>'s Brigade of the King's German
Legion to deploy and advance. The Line was quickly formed; and the
Battalions, bounding across the narrow sunken road, rushed forward,
at a charging pace, driving the Enemy before them. But a body of
<i>Cuirassiers</i>, that had unsuccessfully charged the Left Squares of
<span class="smcap">Kielmansegge</span>'s Hanoverian Brigade, whilst those Battalions
were advancing, came upon the Right Flank of the latter, unexpectedly
for both parties. The 5th Line Battalion, which was on the right,
having been supported in sufficient time by <span class="smcap">Somerset</span>'s
Heavy Cavalry Brigade, suffered little loss; but the 8th Line
Battalion&mdash;being on the left, and more in advance, in the act of
charging when the <i>Cuirassiers</i> appeared&mdash;was completely surprised,
and its Right Wing cut down and dispersed. The Commanding Officer
of the Battalion, Colonel <span class="smcap">Schröder</span>, was mortally wounded:
several other Officers fell: Ensign <span class="smcap">de Moreau</span>, who carried and
defended the King's Colour, having been severely wounded, as also the
Serjeant who afterwards held it, the Enemy succeeded in carrying off
the prize. Major <span class="smcap">Petersdorf</span>, the next in command, collected
the scattered remnant of the Battalion, and posted it in rear of the
hollow way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span></p>

<p>The moment the Anglo-Allied Right Wing became cleared of the presence
of the French Cavalry, it was again exposed to a furious cannonade.
Several of the guns along the main ridge were by this time disabled.
Major <span class="smcap">Bull</span>, who had been obliged at an earlier period to
withdraw his Howitzer Battery to the Second Line for the purpose of
repairing casualties and completing ammunition, advanced again to his
former post in the Front Line, along with Major <span class="smcap">Ramsay</span>'s Horse
Battery, during the Second general Charge of the French Cavalry. These
Batteries suffered severely from <span class="smcap">Piré</span>'s guns, stationed on
the extreme Left of the French Line. <span class="smcap">Bull</span> directed Lieutenant
<span class="smcap">Louis</span> to turn his two right guns towards them, and it was
not long before this Officer succeeded in silencing them; a service
which, as they enfiladed the Allied Right Flank, was of considerable
advantage, during the remainder of the Battle, to all the Batteries and
troops in this part of the Field.</p>

<p>The Duke, considering that a reinforcement of Artillery was
particularly required in front of <span class="smcap">Cooke</span>'s Division and the
Brunswick Infantry against which the Enemy was evidently preparing
fresh attacks, ordered up Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Dickson</span>'s
British Horse Battery, commanded by Major <span class="smcap">Mercer</span>, and
Major <span class="smcap">Sympher</span>'s Horse Battery of the King's German Legion,
into the Front Line: the former, to the left of Lieutenant Colonel
<span class="smcap">Smith</span>'s Horse Battery, in front of the Brunswickers; and the
latter further to the left.</p>

<p>Major <span class="smcap">Mercer</span>'s Battery had barely time to get into action,
when a heavy Column of Cavalry, composed of Horse Grenadiers and
<i>Cuirassiers</i>, was seen ascending the ridge, and advancing at a
rapid rate directly towards the spot upon which it had taken post.
The guns, which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span> nine pounders, were each loaded with a round
and a case shot; and were run close up to a bank of two or three
feet in height, which descended from the narrow cross road along the
ridge, and which thus formed a sort of <i>genouillère</i> to the Battery.
In front, the summit of the ridge consisted of a flat surface, of
forty or fifty yards in width, whence the ground descended rapidly
towards the plain that divided the two Armies. The Column continued
to advance until it came quite close upon these guns, the muzzles of
which were nearly on a level with the cross road; when it suddenly
recoiled from the very destructive fire with which it was received.
The horsemen of the leading Squadrons faced about, and endeavoured to
force their way to the rear; confusion ensued, and the whole mass broke
into a disorderly crowd. Several minutes elapsed ere they succeeded
in quitting the summit of the ridge, during which the fire from the
Battery was incessant; and, from the shortness of the distance, the
size of the objects, and the elevation of the ground on which they
stood, the consequent carnage was truly frightful. Many, instead of
seeking safety in retreat, dashed through the intervals between the
guns, and surrendered: but the greater part, rendered desperate at
finding themselves held, as it were, in front of the Battery, actually
fought their way through their own ranks; and, in the struggle, blows
were exchanged on all sides. At length, the wreck of this formidable
Column gained shelter under the slope of the ridge, leaving the summit
encumbered with its killed and wounded.</p>

<p>About the same time, a strong Column of French Infantry, supported
by Cavalry, was advancing against the Centre of the Anglo-Allied
Right Wing. Whilst the opposed Batteries were concentrating
upon it a vigorous fire, Lord <span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span> brought forward
<span class="smcap">Somerset</span>'s Heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span> Cavalry Brigade from its position on
the right of the Charleroi road, for the purpose of attacking this
Column; and also ordered up, in support, <span class="smcap">Trip</span>'s Dutch-Belgian
Carabinier Brigade. The attack was made with great gallantry by the
Household Cavalry, which succeeded in checking the advance of the
Enemy; but, having been so much reduced in numbers, it was unable
to penetrate the Column, which received it with a heavy fire. As
<span class="smcap">Somerset</span> retired; the French Cavalry by which the Column had
been supported, prepared to advance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trip</span>'s Dutch-Belgian Cavalry was now at hand.
<span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span>, pleased with their fine appearance, and desirous of
exciting in them a courageous enthusiasm, placed himself conspicuously
in their front, and ordering the "Charge," led them towards the Enemy.
He had proceeded but a very short distance, when his Aide de Camp,
Captain <span class="smcap">Horace Seymour</span>, galloped close up to him, and made him
aware that not a single man of them was following him. Turning round
his horse, he instantly rode up to <span class="smcap">Trip</span>, and addressed himself
to this Officer with great warmth. Then, appealing to the Brigade in
terms the most exhorting and encouraging, and inciting them by gestures
the most animated and significant, he repeated the Order to charge, and
again led the way in person. But this attempt was equally abortive;
and <span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span>, exasperated and indignant, rode away from the
Brigade, leaving it to adopt any course which its Commander might think
proper: and as the French Cavalry, to which this hesitation was but too
manifest, was now advancing rapidly to the attack, the Dutch-Belgians
went about, and retired in such haste and disorder that the two Right
Squadrons of the 3rd Hussars of the King's German Legion experienced
the greatest difficulty in maintaining their ground, and avoiding
being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span> carried along to the rear by these horsemen in the wildness of
their flight.</p>

<p>The 3rd Hussars had just moved up into the Second Line, in rear of
<span class="smcap">Kruse</span>'s Nassau Brigade, when this occurred; and the Left
Squadron, being free from any interruption of the kind, gallantly
charged and completely overthrew that portion of the <i>Cuirassiers</i>
which was in its immediate front. As soon as the other two Squadrons
had recovered their order, which had been so unexpectedly disturbed by
the fugitive Dutch-Belgians, the whole Regiment advanced to the crest
of the position; where it received from Lord <span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span>, in
person, the Order to charge a Line of French Cavalry, distant about 150
yards, and consisting of about three Squadrons of <i>Cuirassiers</i> and
three Squadrons of Heavy Dragoons. Commencing the charge with a steady
trot, and then plunging into a gallop, they broke through the Enemy's
Line, which was advancing at a short trot, or almost at a walk; but
became so completely turned and hemmed in upon their flanks and rear,
that a vast proportion of them was cut off. The remainder, dispersed,
and pursued by the French Cavalry, rode back to the Infantry Squares,
in rear of which the Regiment reformed. Here the great loss which it
had suffered in these two attacks become manifest. It was reduced to
between sixty and seventy Files, which were formed into two Squadrons,
and posted in rear of <span class="smcap">Kielmansegge</span>'s Hanoverian Brigade.</p>

<p>About this time, the Earl of <span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span>, on examining the state
of his Cavalry, perceived the Cumberland Regiment of Hanoverian Hussars
at some distance in the rear, on the Brussels road. He immediately
ordered them forward; and on their coming up, he posted them where
they were by no means much exposed, but where they would at least
<i>appear</i> to fill a gap occasioned by the severe losses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span> experienced by
<span class="smcap">Somerset</span>'s and <span class="smcap">Ponsonby</span>'s Brigades: for the manner
of their Commanding Officer, whilst being thus posted, rendered his
Lordship doubtful of their continuing there if attacked.</p>

<p>That he had reason to apprehend something of this kind, was
subsequently proved; for Colonel <span class="smcap">Hake</span>, on finding the shot
flying about him a little, took himself and his Regiment out of the
Field: on discovering which, Lord <span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span> despatched his
Aide de Camp, Captain <span class="smcap">Horace Seymour</span>, with an Order for
his return. When Captain <span class="smcap">Seymour</span> delivered this Order, the
Colonel remarked that he had no confidence in his men, that they
were Volunteers, and that their horses were their own property.
The Regiment continued moving to the rear; notwithstanding Captain
<span class="smcap">Seymour</span>'s repeating the Order to halt, and asking the Second
in Command to save the honour and character of the Corps, by placing
himself at its head and fronting the men. Finding his remonstrances
produced no effect, he laid hold of the bridle of the Colonel's horse,
and commented upon his conduct in terms such as no man of honour
could have been expected to listen to unmoved. This Officer, however,
appeared perfectly callous to any sense of shame; and far more disposed
to submit to those attacks upon his honour than he had been to receive
those of the Enemy upon his person and his Regiment. Upon rejoining
the Earl of <span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span> and relating what had passed; Captain
<span class="smcap">Seymour</span> was again directed to proceed to the Commanding
Officer, and to desire that, if he persevered in refusing to resume his
position in the Line, he would, at least, form the Regiment across the
high road, <i>out</i> of fire. But even this Order was disregarded, and the
Corps went altogether to the rear, spreading alarm and confusion all
the way to Brussels.</p>

<p>In front of the Right of the Anglo-Allied Line, the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span> Column of
Horse Grenadiers and <i>Cuirassiers</i>, which had met with so disastrous a
repulse from Major <span class="smcap">Mercer</span>'s Horse Battery, was reformed for
another attack; to meet which the British Gunners were fully prepared:
for the French horsemen had not retired so far down the hill but that
the high caps of the Horse Grenadiers of the leading Squadrons, were
visible above the brow of the exterior slope. The second attempt was
preluded by a cloud of Skirmishers, who, advancing to within a very
short distance of the front of the Battery, did considerable mischief
to the Gunners with their carbines and pistols; but their intention
being evidently to draw forth their fire, no notice was taken of them.</p>

<p>Then the Column again ascended the ridge, and advanced to attack the
Battery; but on this occasion their pace scarcely exceeded a walk, or
at most a gentle trot, too many obstacles lying in their way to admit
of more rapid movement without confusion. Experience having shown the
Gunners the destructive effects of a close fire, they allowed the
leading Squadrons to attain about half the distance between the brow
of the slope and the narrow road in their front before they commenced.
The result, as may be readily imagined, was precisely similar to that
of the former attack, which has already been detailed. Again the French
horsemen fell into confusion, and again for several minutes were they
exposed to a deliberate and an unerring fire of case shot, within a
distance of not more than twenty yards, so that the pile of killed and
wounded, left on the ground immediately in front of the Battery, before
great, was now enormous.</p>

<p>Other Batteries along this part of the position were equally successful
in repelling the attacks of the Enemy's <i>Cuirassiers</i>, who were
assembling in considerable numbers at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span> the foot of the exterior slope,
close to the Hougomont inclosures, apparently with the object of
cutting off the direct communication with that Post, and forcing the
Right of the Allied Front Line. The moment seemed favourable for such a
project. Several of the Allied guns had by this time become completely
disabled; the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd British Guards, awfully
reduced, had been driven into the hollow way in rear of the Orchards
of Hougomont; the young Brunswick Infantry had suffered severe losses;
and the supporting Cavalry had become greatly exhausted by its repeated
charges.</p>

<p>But <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, foreseeing the probability of a serious
attempt upon this weakened point of his Line, and perceiving the
approach of <span class="smcap">Chassé</span>'s Division (see page 458), supplied the
required remedy by desiring Lord <span class="smcap">Hill</span> to bring forward troops
from the Second Line. The zeal, intelligence, and activity which had
ever characterized the Hero of Almaraz and Arroyo del Molino when
carrying out the designs of the Chief under whom he had acquired a
lasting fame, seemed but to wait this summons to the more immediate
scene of action, to appear again in all their accustomed vigour. He
immediately put in motion <span class="smcap">du Plat</span>'s Infantry Brigade of the
King's German Legion. As the latter advanced across the Nivelles road,
from its left, the 2nd Line Battalion became the leading Column. It
was followed by the 4th, then by the 3rd, and lastly by the 1st Line
Battalion. As the 2nd approached the crest of the ridge, several
Gunners ran in upon it for shelter from the Enemy's <i>Cuirassiers</i>,
whose main body was now advancing against this Battalion. The four
Light Companies of the Brigade, however, had just posted themselves
close to the three small trees near this part of the crest of the
ridge; and being armed with rifles, they delivered so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span> destructive a
fire into the Cavalry as to compel it to withdraw.</p>

<p>Some of the Allied Cavalry then moved forward in pursuit, and <span class="smcap">du
Plat</span>'s Brigade continued its advance until the 2nd Line Battalion
had approached close to the hedge of the Great Orchard of Hougomont,
whence a dropping fire was opened upon the Germans by the French
Skirmishers. The Dragoons made a sudden and rapid retreat through
the intervals of the Columns, in left front of which a fresh Line
of hostile Cavalry now presented itself. Captain <span class="smcap">Sympher</span>,
who, with his Horse Battery of the Legion, had accompanied <span class="smcap">du
Plat</span>'s advance, instantly unlimbered; and poured round shot
through the intervals of the Columns, the latter maintaining, at the
same time, a very effective independent file fire. The <i>Cuirassiers</i>
gallantly advanced, notwithstanding this formidable resistance. They
first became exposed to a flank fire from the left face of the 4th
Line Battalion Square, and then again to that from the left face of
the 3rd Line Battalion: nevertheless, they resolutely attacked the
Battery, the Gunners of which either flew to the last mentioned Square
for protection, or sought shelter under the carriages. At length, after
having suffered severe losses by the unremitting fire from the nearest
Squares, the French Cavalry retired in disorder; receiving a renewed
discharge from the Battery, which was again in full play.</p>

<p>When <span class="smcap">du Plat</span>'s Brigade moved down the slope, the 2nd and 3rd
Light, and 2nd Line, Battalions of the Brunswickers, advanced a short
distance over the crest of the ridge, in left rear of the former.
Here they became exposed to a destructive fire of both artillery and
musketry, the latter from the French Skirmishers that had crept from
along the eastern hedge of Hougomont, close under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span> brow of that
part of the Anglo-Allied position. They withstood this heavy fire,
as also the subsequent charges of Cavalry, with great steadiness and
courage; but as soon as the French horsemen were driven back by a
portion of the Allied Cavalry (consisting of the 23rd British Light
Dragoons, the 1st Light Dragoons of the King's German Legion, and the
Brunswick Hussars and Lancers), the above mentioned Battalions withdrew
from their exposed situation to the interior slope.</p>

<p>The French Skirmishers, who had, during this last attack by their
Cavalry, pushed forward a very considerable force through the Great
Orchard of Hougomont, and along its eastern boundary, now concentrated
a most galling fire upon the Squares of the Legionary Brigade, whose
Commander, <span class="smcap">du Plat</span>, was mortally wounded; several Officers
fell, and all those that were mounted had their horses shot under them.
The fire ceased; and in the next moment the <i>Cuirassiers</i>, having
rallied, renewed their charge: but with no greater success than before;
and a third charge proved equally ineffectual against the determined
bravery and patient endurance of the soldiers of the Legion.</p>

<p>About the time that <span class="smcap">du Plat</span>'s Brigade moved into the First
Line, a considerable body of French <i>Cuirassiers</i>, which still remained
in the hollow westward of La Haye Sainte, exposed to a fire from one or
two of the Allied Batteries, advanced at a walk, to make another effort
to break the Right Centre of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Line. This proved as
unsuccessful as the previous attacks. The Squares, reserving their fire
until the close approach of the hostile Cavalry, and then directing it
against the latter in the most cool and deliberate manner, which the
absence of all impetus in an attack at a walk enabled them to do with
unerring effect, soon compelled the shattered Squadrons once more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span> to
withdraw from a contest which the unexampled steadiness of the Allied
Infantry had rendered almost hopeless on their part.</p>

<p>The French Cavalry that attacked the Squares of <span class="smcap">du Plat</span>'s
Brigade, immediately in rear of Hougomont, had no sooner been driven
off by the gallant resistance of the Germans, than the Skirmishers,
who, as before observed, had advanced in such numbers along the eastern
inclosures of that Post, crept close up under the brow of that part of
the ridge on the interior slope of which was posted the main body of
the Brunswick Infantry.</p>

<p>At this time, however, Lord <span class="smcap">Hill</span> was bringing forward
<span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s British Light Infantry Brigade, having directed it
to cross the Nivelles road, and to advance in Columns up the slope,
in rear of the Brunswickers. (The Brigade had, some time before,
been moved from the plateau on the right, close to the edge of the
Nivelles road, in which position it had continued in immediate
reserve.) Suddenly the summit in its front was crowded with the French
Skirmishers, who were almost as quickly concealed by the smoke from
the rattling fire which they opened upon the Allied Artillery and the
Squares. The Gunners, whose numbers were fearfully diminished, were
speedily driven back from their crippled Batteries upon the nearest
Infantry; upon which the concentration of this galling fire threatened
the most serious consequences.</p>

<p>But succour was at hand. <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, in the midst of the
shower of bullets, had galloped to the front of <span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s
Brigade, ordered it to form Line, four deep; and then, pointing to the
daring Skirmishers on the Height, called out, with perfect coolness and
unaffected assurance, "Drive those fellows away!" With loud cheers,
the Brigade moved rapidly up the slope, eager to obey the Duke's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
command. From the want of sufficient space, the 52nd Regiment was not
formed in Line with, but in rear of, the 71st and 2nd Battalion of
the 95th Regiment, to which it consequently served as a Support. The
French Skirmishers began to give way as the firm and intrepid front of
the Brigade presented itself to their view. <span class="smcap">Adam</span> continued
his advance, driving the French Infantry before him. On crossing the
ridge, the Brigade brought forward its right shoulders, and, when
halted, it stood in a slight hollow; which, commencing in front of
the right of the position occupied by <span class="smcap">Maitland</span>'s Brigade of
Guards, descends towards the north-east angle of the Great Orchard of
Hougomont. At the former point the 2nd Battalion of the 95th Regiment
formed the Left; and at the latter, the 71st Regiment with the two
Companies of the 3rd Battalion of the 95th Regiment formed the Right,
of this Line. The Enemy's Cavalry having been perceived preparing
for attack, the Battalions of the Brigade formed Squares: and as the
interval between the 71st and the 2nd Battalion 95th Regiment, in this
new position, was larger than was desirable; Colonel Sir <span class="smcap">John
Colborne</span> moved down the 52nd Regiment, in Squares of Wings of
Battalions, to fill up the space; which he reached just in time to
throw a most effective oblique fire upon the Cavalry which was in the
act of attacking the 71st Regiment.</p>

<p>The French Carabiniers and Horse Grenadiers of the Guard made some
gallant attacks upon the Brigade. They generally advanced by <i>their</i>
right of the Hougomont inclosures, then fell upon the 71st Regiment, by
which their charge was invariably broken; when such portions of them as
continued in any degree of order, rushed onward in apparent infatuation
upon the Right Wing Square of the 52nd Regiment; from the front and
right faces of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span> they received a close, well directed fire, which
completed their disorder and confusion.</p>

<p>In one of these attacks, Major <span class="smcap">Eeles</span>, whose Company of the 3rd
Battalion 95th Rifles was attached to the 71st Regiment, upon observing
the approach of the Carabiniers towards the right angle of the front
face of the Square, moved his Company to the right, in line with the
rear face, and, placing himself in its front, prevented his men from
firing until the Carabiniers approached within thirty or forty yards
of the Square; when he ordered a volley, which, combined with a cross
fire from the 71st, brought down so many horses and men to the ground,
at the same moment, that the further progress of the charge was most
effectually frustrated. In an instant, one half of the attacking force
was on the ground; some few men and horses were killed; more were
wounded; but by far the greater part were thrown down over the dead,
the dying, and the wounded. These, after a short interval, began to
extricate themselves from the mass, and made the best of their way back
to their Supports; some on horseback but most of them on foot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s Brigade, by means of the advanced position which it
thus occupied, along the space between the Hougomont inclosures and
the right front of <span class="smcap">Maitland</span>'s Brigade, presented an effectual
barrier to the advance of the French Cavalry against that portion
of the Allied Front Line which was situated upon the right of the
latter point. In the intervals between the charges of Cavalry, it
suffered severely from the Enemy's Artillery; more particularly the
71st Regiment, and 2nd Battalion 95th Rifles, the position of these
Regiments being somewhat more exposed than that of the 52nd.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halkett</span>'s Hanoverian Brigade had moved from its present
position, near Merbe Braine, into the space within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span> the angle formed
by the Nivelles road and the hollow way which leads from the Right
of the Front Line down into the low ground below Hougomont; and it
was shortly after <span class="smcap">Adam</span> moved into his forward position, that
<span class="smcap">Halkett</span> advanced, with the Landwehr Battalions Osnabrück and
Salzgitter, and took post on the exterior slope of the main ridge, in
rear of <span class="smcap">du Plat</span>'s Brigade.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was now about six o'clock. The formidable attacks made by the French
along the entire Line of the Anglo-Allied Army had been productive
of no positive advantage; the Advanced Posts of Hougomont and La
Haye Sainte had successfully resisted the furious assaults which had
hitherto been directed against them: and the forward position taken
up by <span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s British Brigade, made it manifest to the French
Emperor that, notwithstanding the gallantry, enthusiasm, and devotion
displayed in those attacks by the finest troops he had ever assembled
together, headed, too, by Generals of the highest celebrity; still
greater efforts, and still greater sacrifices must be made if he hoped
to drive the British lion from the position which it yet proudly
retained with so firm a footing, before the Prussian eagle, which for
some time past had hovered over, and was at this moment darting at, his
extreme Right, should alight, in the plenitude of its force, to satiate
its thirst for vengeance in the fierce and sanguinary struggle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> sent an Order to <span class="smcap">Ney</span> to renew the attack
upon the Centre. To execute this with effect, however, fresh Infantry
was requisite; and the Marshal had none at his disposal. He therefore
despatched his first Aide de Camp, Colonel <span class="smcap">Heymès</span>, to
represent to the Emperor the exhausted condition of his troops: half
of which were placed <i>hors de combat</i>, and the other half overcome by
fatigue, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span> failing in ammunition; and to request he would send him
reinforcements. At this moment, however, <span class="smcap">Lobau</span>'s Corps and
the Young Guard were required for the security of the French Right
Flank against the offensive operations of the Prussians; consequently,
the Battalions of the Old Guard, which constituted the only remaining
Reserve of Infantry, could not be spared. To <span class="smcap">Ney</span>'s demand for
fresh troops, <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> therefore replied,&mdash;"<i>Ou voulez vous
que j'en prenne? Voulez vous que j'en fusse?</i>"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ney</span>, on being made acquainted with the manner in which his
request had been received, saw very plainly that the Battle was far
from being gained: and darted off to animate, by his presence, the
attack which was now renewed upon La Haye Sainte; and which was covered
by a vigorous fire from the French Artillery against that portion of
the Anglo-Allied Line immediately in rear of this Post, in order to
disturb any attempt to relieve or assist its defenders.</p>

<p>The united remains of <span class="smcap">Somerset</span>'s and <span class="smcap">Ponsonby</span>'s
Brigades, which were on the reverse slope, behind <span class="smcap">Ompteda</span>'s
Brigade of the King's German Legion, and which were extended in Single
File for the purpose of making a <i>show</i> of force, suffered much from
this cannonade. On perceiving its effects, Lord <span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span> sent
an Aide de Camp to recommend Lord <span class="smcap">Edward Somerset</span> to withdraw
his men from the range of the Enemy's guns. The latter sent back word
that, were he to do so, the Dutch-Belgian Cavalry, who were in support,
would immediately move off the Field! <span class="smcap">Somerset</span> retained his
position until the end of the Battle.</p>

<p>Shortly before the Columns from <span class="smcap">Donzelot</span>'s Division advanced
to this attack of La Haye Sainte, a party of Horse Artillery, which
had been detached from <span class="smcap">Whinyates</span>'s Rocket Battery, proceeded,
under Captain <span class="smcap">Dansey</span>, along the Charleroi road, to the front
of the Centre of the Anglo-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>Allied Line, and came into action with
rockets, near that Farm, leaving its two guns in the rear, under
Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Wright</span>.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Dansey</span> very soon received a severe wound, which
obliged him to retire; and the party, after firing a few rockets,
fell back a little, to where its horses were standing. It was then
commanded by a Serjeant (<span class="smcap">Daniel Dunnett</span>), who, on perceiving
the advance of the nearest French Column towards the Farm, dismounted
his men as coolly and deliberately as if exercising on Woolwich Common,
though without any Support whatever; laid rockets on the ground,
and discharged them in succession into the mass&mdash;every one of them
appearing to take effect. The advance of the Column was checked, and
was not resumed until Sergeant <span class="smcap">Dunnett</span>, having expended all
his rockets, retired with his party to rejoin the guns in rear.</p>

<p>Major <span class="smcap">Baring</span>'s Detachment, after its extraordinary and
successful exertions in repelling the previous assaults, was fearfully
reduced in numbers; but its excellent spirit and conspicuous bravery
remained unshaken. One circumstance, however, could not fail to render
unavailing all their efforts, their courage, and their endurance.
Notwithstanding Major <span class="smcap">Baring</span>'s urgently repeated applications
for a supply of ammunition, his men were still left without the means
of adequately defending their Post against the host of enemies by which
they were successively assailed.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span> cheerfully repaired, as far
as practicable, the gaps made in the walls by the French Artillery,
and betrayed no despondency as they looked upon the sad and numerous
proofs that lay around them of the immense sacrifices they had already
made. But when, upon counting the cartridges, they discovered that they
had not, upon an average, more than from three to four each, their
consciousness of the desperate situation to which they were reduced,
and of the impossibility of holding out under such circumstances, led
to remonstrances, which their gallant Commander could not but admit
to be reasonable. Yet no sooner did the latter, upon perceiving two
French Columns again advancing towards the Farm, exhort them to renewed
courage, and also to a careful economy of the ammunition, than he
received the unanimous reply,&mdash;"No man will desert you,&mdash;we will fight
and die with you!"</p>

<p>The French, exasperated by the protracted resistance of this handful
of brave defenders, now came on with redoubled fury. The open end of
the Great Barn was first assailed. Again they succeeded in setting
the building on fire; but the Germans, having recourse to the same
expedient as on the previous occasion, again contrived to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span> extinguish
the flames. <span class="smcap">Baring</span>'s anxiety and uneasiness increased with
every shot that was fired by his men; and he again sent to the rear
for ammunition, coupling his demand with a distinct report, that he
must and would abandon the place should no supply be forthcoming.
This message, however, proved equally ineffectual. The fire of
the garrison was gradually diminishing: perplexity was depicted
in every countenance: many of the men now called out urgently for
ammunition,&mdash;"We will readily stand by you, but we must have the means
of defending ourselves!" Even their Officers, who during the whole day
had displayed the greatest courage, represented to their Commander the
impossibility of retaining the Post under such circumstances.</p>

<p>The French, who failed not to observe the distressing situation to
which the defenders were reduced, now boldly broke in the door at that
end of the long western building which is nearest to the entrance of
the Great Barn, already so frequently assailed. The passage from the
door through the building into the Farm yard having been barricaded,
but few of the Enemy could enter at a time. These were instantly
bayoneted, and the rear hesitated to follow. They now climbed up the
outer wall of the long building, and mounted the roof, from which they
easily picked off the defenders; who, not possessing the means of
retaliation, were completely at their mercy. At the same time, they
pressed in through the open Barn, which it was impossible to defend any
longer. <span class="smcap">Baring</span> was now reduced to the painful necessity of
abandoning the place, and gave the Order to retire through the Dwelling
House into the Garden. Many of the men were overtaken in the narrow
passage through the House by the victors, who vented their fury upon
them in the lowest abuse and most brutal treatment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baring</span> having satisfied himself that the possession of the
Dwelling House by the Enemy must render the Garden quite untenable; and
finding that his Officers fully agreed with him on this point, he made
the men retire, singly, to the main position. The greater part of them,
accompanied by their brave but disconsolate Commander, descended into
the high road by an opening in the bank adjoining the north-east angle
of the Garden, and retired along the opposite side of the <i>chaussée</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baring</span> sent back to their respective Regiments the remains of
the reinforcements he had received; and, with the few men that were
left of his own Battalion, he attached himself to two Companies of the
1st Light Battalion of the King's German Legion, which were then posted
in the hollow way close to the right of the high road.</p>

<p>The surrender of La Haye Sainte, under the circumstances which have
been described, was as purely honourable, as its defence against an
overwhelming and furious host had been heroically brave. A thorough
conviction that further resistance must have been marked by the
sacrifice of the entire remnant of his courageous band at once
suggested to the mind of a Commander like <span class="smcap">Baring</span>, gifted
with the requisite discernment and forethought of a true soldier,
the reservation of such gallant spirits for some other part of the
great contest; in which they might yet face their enemies, if not on
equal terms, at least in a manner that would render their bravery and
devotion not altogether unavailable in the general struggle for victory.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Loud and reiterated shouts of triumph having announced to the French
Emperor the capture of La Haye Sainte; he immediately ordered it to be
followed up by a vigorous attack upon the Centre of the Anglo-Allied
Line, and by a simultaneous renewal of the assault upon Hougomont.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span></p>

<p>It was quite evident to <span class="smcap">Ney</span>, that without an additional force
of Infantry, it would be impossible for him to follow up, with effect,
the advantage which he anticipated from the capture of La Haye Sainte.
The Cavalry, which <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> had placed at his disposal, had
been nearly annihilated in the course of its numerous attacks upon
the Anglo-Allied Line,&mdash;attacks executed throughout with the greatest
gallantry, but unproductive of any solid or decisive result upon a
single point of that Line. If this Arm, comprising the flower of the
chivalric Cavalry of France, had failed him when it sallied forth,
gaily exulting in the freshness of its vigour, proudly conscious of the
imposing attitude of its masses, and unrestrainedly impatient for the
onslaught which was to exalt still more its already high renown; how
could he calculate upon its efficacy, now that it was comparatively
paralyzed?</p>

<p>The state to which his Infantry was reduced presented a prospect
almost as cheerless. <span class="smcap">D'Erlon</span>'s Corps, severely crippled by
its signally unsuccessful attack upon the Anglo-Allied Left Wing and
Centre, had still further exhausted its force by repeated assaults
against La Haye Sainte, on its left; and, since the arrival of
<span class="smcap">Bülow</span>, it had been compelled to resort to active precautionary
measures on its right. On the other hand, <span class="smcap">Reille</span>'s Corps had
suffered immense losses in its incessant, yet unavailing, efforts to
gain possession of the important Post of Hougomont.</p>

<p>But <span class="smcap">Ney</span>, <i>le plus brave des braves</i>, in whose character
resolution and perseverance were pre-eminent, was not to be deterred
by this discouraging aspect, from fulfilling, to the best of his
abilities, the task imposed upon him by his Imperial Master. There can
be but little doubt that at the time he made his urgent demand upon the
Emperor for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span> fresh supply of Infantry, he had projected an assault
upon the Anglo-Allied Right Wing, in accordance with that prominent
feature in the tactics of the Empire,&mdash;the Column of Attack in mass
of Battalions&mdash;to be supported by his Cavalry, whilst this Arm still
continued vigorous and effective. Now, however, his exhausted means
precluded the execution of such a plan of attack; and he therefore had
recourse, as far as was practicable with his reduced extent of force,
to another system, which had been attended with so much success in the
time of the Republic, and which had always found great favour with
the French soldiery&mdash;the grand attack <i>en Tirailleurs</i>. In this way
he would be better enabled to conceal the weakened condition of his
troops; and he might also succeed in making such an impression upon
some important point of the Allied Line, as would induce the Emperor
to seize upon the advantage gained, and, launching forth his Reserve,
strike the decisive blow.</p>

<p>The whole of <span class="smcap">Donzelot</span>'s Division, supported by a part of
<span class="smcap">Alix</span>'s Division, as also a considerable body of <i>Cuirassiers</i>,
forming the gallant remnants of entire Regiments, were put in
motion against the Centre of the Anglo-Allied Line; whilst fresh
reinforcements were poured down from <span class="smcap">Reille</span>'s Corps into the
Hougomont inclosures.</p>

<p>The first disposition made by the captors of La Haye Sainte, was to
avail themselves of the advantage which the possession of the Farm
House, the Garden, and the adjacent high bank, afforded them for
pouring a commanding fire upon the two Companies of the 95th British
Rifles which occupied the Knoll by the Sand Pit on the opposite side of
the road; when these, being at the same time pressed in front, finding
their Post no longer tenable, retreated upon their main body in the
Wavre road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span></p>

<p>The French at the same time contrived to push two guns round by the
Garden hedge to the bank of the high road, and immediately opened a
fire of grape upon <span class="smcap">Kempt</span>'s Brigade posted along, and in rear
of, the Wavre road, on the opposite side of the <i>chaussée</i>; but this
was speedily silenced by the 1st Battalion of the 95th British Rifles,
who, taking a deliberate aim at the Artillerymen, destroyed them before
they could discharge a second round.</p>

<p>There then issued from under cover of the Farm, a large body of
Infantry, which, as it ascended the main ridge, spread out into a very
close Line of Skirmishers, who pressed boldly forward against the Left
of <span class="smcap">Alten</span>'s Division. Their concentrated fire was telling
fearfully upon the devoted Squares. <span class="smcap">Alten</span> sent an Order to
<span class="smcap">Ompteda</span> to deploy one of his Battalions, if practicable, and
advance against the Enemy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ompteda</span>, as brave and high minded a soldier as ever graced the
profession of arms, was quite prepared to execute the Order: but being
fully aware, from previous observation, that in the hollow behind the
curtain formed by the <i>Tirailleurs</i> there lay in wait a body of the
Enemy's Cavalry; he felt it his duty to represent the imminent risk
which was likely to attend such a movement.</p>

<p>At this moment of hesitation, the Prince of <span class="smcap">Orange</span> rode up to
<span class="smcap">Ompteda</span> and ordered him to deploy. The latter respectfully
submitted the same opinion he had before expressed to <span class="smcap">Alten</span>'s
messenger; whereupon his Royal Highness became impatient, repeated
the Order, and forbade further reply. <span class="smcap">Ompteda</span>, with the
true spirit of a soldier, instantly deployed the 5th Line Battalion,
placed himself at its head, and gallantly led it against the mass of
<i>Tirailleurs</i>, who had continued to crowd forward; and under whose
teazing fire the Germans displayed the greatest steadiness and bravery.
The French gave way as the Line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span> advanced at the charge; and as it
approached the Garden of La Haye Sainte, they suddenly and rapidly
sought shelter along the hedges. In the next moment, the Battalion was
furiously assailed by a Regiment of <i>Cuirassiers</i>; who, taking the
Line in its Right Flank, fairly rolled it up. This Cavalry charge,
preconcerted with great skill, and executed with amazing rapidity,
proved awfully destructive to the courageous but unfortunate Germans;
and fully, and fatally, confirmed the truth of the unheeded prediction
of their intrepid Commander. So severe was the loss sustained, that
out of the whole Battalion, not more than about thirty men with a
few Officers were gradually collected in the hollow way that lay
along the front of the Left of the Brigade. Amongst the slain was
<span class="smcap">Ompteda</span> himself, who with his followers, thus fell a sacrifice
to the absence of that precaution, the necessity for which he had
vainly endeavoured to impress upon his superior Officer.</p>

<p>Whilst the French <i>Cuirassiers</i> were cutting and stabbing in all
directions, and completing their work of destruction amidst the
unfortunate Germans; the 95th British Rifles, who, from the other
side of the high road, had been attentive observers of the scene, had
already taken aim at the <i>Cuirassiers</i>, but had refrained from firing,
fearing to injure their friends, at length poured in amongst them a
terrific volley, just at the very moment when the 3rd Hussars of the
King's German Legion advanced to the rescue of their compatriots:
which sent both sides flying, and completely cleared the front of
<span class="smcap">Ompteda</span>'s Brigade.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the 3rd Hussars again advanced: but the Support of
the <i>Cuirassiers</i> having, in the mean time, ascended the slope: the
former, so inferior in numbers, were brought to a stand; and, after a
brief struggle, were compelled to withdraw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span></p>

<p>A mass of <i>Tirailleurs</i> now ascended by their left, from the hollow
westward of La Haye Sainte (in which hollow they could assemble in
comparative security since the capture of that Post by the French),
and pushed forward with great boldness against the Advanced Square
of <span class="smcap">Maitland</span>'s British Brigade, formed by the 3rd Battalion
of the 1st Foot Guards. Their fire, concentrated upon the Square and
maintained with astonishing rapidity and vigour, was most galling
to the British Guards. Also upon their left, another portion of
their numbers poured a destructive fire upon the Left Square of
<span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s Brigade, formed by the 2nd Battalion of the 95th Rifles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maitland</span>, perceiving the serious annoyance which his 3rd
Battalion experienced from the fire of the French Skirmishers, directed
Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">D'Oyley</span>, who commanded it, to advance for
the purpose of dislodging them; and being well aware that some of the
Enemy's Cavalry were drawn up near the foot of the slope, he threw the
flank faces of the Square into sections, in which order the Battalion
moved forward, being thus prepared to reform Square with the greatest
expedition. Under a tremendous fire from the opposite French Batteries,
which had perceived this movement, the Guards gallantly drove the
Skirmishers down the slope; and so marked was their steadiness on
this occasion, that a body of French Cavalry, which was now observed
approaching, struck with the promptitude and precision with which the
gaps caused in their ranks by the round shot were closed, neither
assaulted them in their advance nor molested them in their retreat to
their position on the brow of the hill, which was effected in perfect
order. The Cavalry, though it refrained from attacking, received the
fire of the Guards; and then, dashing along the front of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span> 52nd
Regiment, it exposed itself to another vigorous fire by which it was
nearly destroyed.</p>

<p>Of all the troops comprising the Anglo-Allied Army at Waterloo, the
most exposed to the fierce onslaught of the French Cavalry and to the
continuous cannonade of their Artillery, were the two British Squares
posted, during a very great portion of the Battle, in advance&mdash;at
times, considerably so&mdash;of the narrow road which ran along the crest
of the Duke's position. They consisted of the 3rd Battalion of the
1st Guards, belonging to <span class="smcap">Maitland</span>'s Brigade; and of the
30th and 73rd Regiments acting together as one Corps, belonging to
<span class="smcap">Halkett</span>'s Brigade. It was upon these troops that fell the
first burst of the grand Cavalry attacks; and it was upon these
troops, also, that the French Gunners seldom neglected to pour their
destructive missiles, so long as they continued to constitute, by their
exposed position, such prominent marks for their fire.</p>

<p>An attack upon the Square of the Guards by Skirmishers has just been
described; and it was not long after this that the Square of the 30th
and 73rd was attacked by some French Artillery, which trotted boldly up
the slope directly in front of those Regiments, and having approached
within a fearfully short distance, unlimbered two of its guns, from
which several rounds of grape were discharged in rapid succession,
into the very heart of the Square. Awful gaps were made in its devoted
ranks; but the readiness and alacrity with which they were filled up,
at the commands of their Officers, by men prepared to share the same
fate as that which had befallen their predecessors, was truly heroic.
That an occasional murmur broke forth, cannot be denied&mdash;not, however,
at their exposed situation, but at the stern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span> refusal to allow them to
charge the guns; near which the French Cavalry was hovering, ready to
take advantage of any such attempt.</p>

<p>The Duke was frequently an eye witness of this devotedness of his
soldiers; but when asked for support, his reply was that there was
none to spare; or, if for permission to attack, that this could not be
granted; and, if any intimation were made to him that it might become
necessary to fall back a little out of fire, it was met, in a cool and
decided tone, that every man must stand his ground, and that there must
not even be a semblance of retreat.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The reinforcements from <span class="smcap">Reille</span>'s Corps having moved to
Hougomont, the Skirmishers in and around this Post were relieved
upon all points. The Wood, as also the fences on either flank, soon
swarmed with <i>Tirailleurs</i>; and the brisk rattle of musketry that
followed, intermingled with shouts of "<i>En avant!</i>", seemed to betoken
a determination on the part of the French that the capture of La
Haye Sainte should not be their only triumph achieved in front of
the Anglo-Allied Army. Everywhere the assault was bravely met by the
gallant defenders of the Post. The Flank Companies of the Guards,
within the walls and buildings, held at defiance every attempt of
their assailants to dislodge them from their cover. By this time, all
the outhouses were on fire, with the exception of those that fronted
the Wood. The roof and upper storey of the Château had fallen in, and
flames continued bursting forth on all sides with the greatest fury.
The heat had become so intense as to produce upon the men whose duty
brought them within its influence, a feeling of suffocation; while the
frequently emitted volumes of thick smoke gave an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span> indistinctness to
every object around them. Yet so admirable was the system of defence,
so perfect were the discipline and the order, maintained throughout
this trying scene by the devoted garrison, that the Enemy completely
failed in forcing an opening at any one point. The well maintained
fire from the walls was such as to deter the French from attempting an
escalade.</p>

<p>Whilst the central portion of the <span class="smcap">Tirailleurs</span> kept up an
incessant fire from behind the hedge and trees facing the south
buildings and the Gardens, the remainder pressed on in crowds against
the inclosures by which the Post was flanked. On the right, the 2nd
Battalion of the Coldstream Guards, lining the hedge that bordered
the main approach to the Château, successfully withstood this furious
onset. On the left, the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Guards, in the
Orchard, having suffered such frightful losses, found it impossible to
stem the overwhelming torrent, and speedily fell back upon its friendly
hollow way. The French <i>Tirailleurs</i>, pushing forward in pursuit, were
staggered by the sudden and vigorous fire opened upon them by the
troops within the eastern Garden Wall; and the 3rd Guards having, in
the mean time, been reinforced by the 2nd Line Battalion and the Light
Companies of <span class="smcap">du Plat</span>'s Brigade, drove the Enemy back to the
front hedge of the Orchard; whence they were shortly, in their turn,
compelled to retire.</p>

<p>Again the flank fire from the eastern Garden Wall, combined with that
in front from the defenders of the Orchard, as they reached the rear
hedge, compelled the Enemy to fall back. The 3rd Guards once more
lined the front hedge; and also, in conjunction with the Light Troops
of <span class="smcap">du Plat</span>'s Brigade, and the remains of both the Brunswick
Advanced Guard Battalion, and the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of
Nassau, forced the entrance into the Wood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span> near the south-east angle of
the Garden Wall, and firmly established themselves in that quarter.</p>

<p>At the commencement of this last mentioned attack upon Hougomont, the
Right of <span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s Brigade was considered too near the inclosures
of that Post, and exposed to be taken from thence in flank. It was
therefore withdrawn further up the slope, towards the crest of the
main position; and after a brief interval, it retired to the reverse
slope in order to be covered from the Enemy's cannonade which had been
directed against it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was now nearly seven o'clock. The troops defending Hougomont and
its inclosures had succeeded in repelling the last assault; and the
contest in and around this Post again degenerated into a <i>tiraillade</i>
kept up with more or less vigour on all points. Along the front of
the extreme Right of the Anglo-Allied Line, the Skirmishers from
<span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>'s British Infantry Brigade maintained their ground
with great steadiness and gallantry. The main body of the Brunswick
Infantry stood on the interior slope, in rear of <span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s
Brigade; and <span class="smcap">Chassé</span>'s Dutch-Belgian Infantry Division, which
had arrived from Braine l'Alleud, was deployed along, and in rear of,
the Nivelles road, its Centre intersected by the narrow road leading
from the <i>chaussée</i> to the Village of Merbe Braine, which position it
had taken up on the advance of <span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s Brigade to the general
Front Line. In front of the Anglo-Allied Left, the Skirmishers of both
Armies were continually engaged; and upon the extreme Left the troops
in Smohain, La Haye, Papelotte, and adjacent inclosures, successfully
resisted all attempts of the Enemy to dislodge them.</p>

<p>The attack upon the Centre of the Anglo-Allied Line had been incessant
from the moment La Haye Sainte fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span> into the possession of the French.
On their left of the Charleroi road, they debouched from that Farm and
ascended the position in clouds of Skirmishers. One portion of them
crowded upon the artificial mound which abutted upon the high bank
of the road, and was situated about sixty yards only in front of the
hollow way occupied by <span class="smcap">Ompteda</span>'s Brigade. On the opposite
side of the Charleroi road, the fire from the French troops on the
Knoll above the Sand Pit was maintained with remarkable rapidity
and perseverance. They continued, as before, to conceal themselves
as much as possible under the brow of the Knoll, exposing only so
much of their bodies as was necessary to enable them to fire over
its crest in a kneeling position. This fire was replied to with the
greatest spirit and determination on the part of <span class="smcap">Kempt</span>'s and
<span class="smcap">Lambert</span>'s Brigades. On the Allied right of the high road, the
exhausted remnant of <span class="smcap">Ompteda</span>'s Brigade was no longer a match
for the daring <i>Tirailleurs</i> that crowded together in its front. Its
stock of ammunition had begun to fail; many who had not a cartridge
left fell to the rear, and more than the usual number assisted the
wounded out of action.</p>

<p>Exposed as <span class="smcap">Alten</span>'s Division had been to the most furious
assaults of Artillery, Cavalry, and Infantry; the British and German
Brigades of which it was composed had become awfully diminished; and
the facility which the possession of La Haye Sainte now afforded the
French for continuing their desperate endeavours to force that part
of the Allied Line, rendered the situation of these troops extremely
critical. <span class="smcap">Alten</span>, who had throughout the day displayed the
same coolness, intrepidity, and skill, which had characterised his
career in the Peninsular War; and who, by his presence and example,
had so powerfully sustained the energies of his men, was not permitted
to witness the closing scene of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span> glorious exertions: for about
this time he was wounded, and compelled to quit the Field; leaving the
command of the Division to his gallant countryman <span class="smcap">Kielmansegge</span>.</p>

<p>At a short distance in rear of <span class="smcap">Lambert</span>'s Brigade stood that of
<span class="smcap">Pack</span> (with the exception of the 1st Royal Scots, then in Front
Line), in Contiguous Columns at quarter distance, its Right resting
on the high road; while further to the rear, as a Reserve, was posted
<span class="smcap">Vincke</span>'s Hanoverian Brigade, having two of its Battalions,
Hameln and Gifhorn, in contiguous Close Columns on the left of the
road, and the other Battalions, Piene and Hildesheim, in a similar
formation, on the right of the road, near the Farm of Mont St Jean.</p>

<p>The pertinacity and zeal displayed by the French in their attacks upon
the Centre of the Anglo-Allied Line, and the indications now manifested
of following them up with increased force, were in accordance with
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s great object of breaking that Centre, and
overthrowing the Right Wing of the Duke's Army: and for the execution
of this latter part of his plan, he was preparing to strike another
formidable blow; even now that the Prussians were fairly <i>aux prises</i>
with the troops constituting the extreme Right of his Army in and
around Planchenoit.</p>

<p>But previously to entering into the subject of the concluding scene
of the struggle between the Anglo-Allied and French Armies, it will
be necessary to revert to the operations of the Prussian Forces,
in order to arrive at a full and comprehensive development and due
interconnection of all the leading features and various bearings of the
great Battle, the result of which was to determine the issue of the
Campaign in Belgium.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Two different causes have been assigned for the
non-compliance with Major <span class="smcap">Baring</span>'s requisitions for
ammunition; namely, the interception of the communication between
the Post and the main Line and the difficulty in procuring <i>rifle</i>
ammunition. The first appears scarcely tenable; for, although the
communication was frequently cut off by the French, as they passed
by the Farm when attacking the main position, it was as frequently
open and available. This is sufficiently proved by the different
reinforcements that were sent into the Farm: ammunition might have been
escorted thither with equal facility; and yet <span class="smcap">Baring</span> had made
three distinct applications for a supply <i>before</i> the Nassau Detachment
was added to his force. The difficulty of procuring <i>rifle</i> ammunition
certainly appears a more probable cause; but, even in this case, it is
impossible to overlook the circumstance that the Post in question was
immediately in front of the Brigade to which its defenders belonged,
and of which two out of the four Battalions composing it were armed
with rifles.
</p>
<p>
Since the above was written it has been communicated to me from
Hanover, upon excellent authority, that the cause of Major
<span class="smcap">Baring</span> not having been supplied with ammunition arose from the
circumstance, that there existed only one cart with rifle ammunition
for the two Light Battalions of the King's German Legion; and that this
cart was involved in the precipitate retreat of a great part of the
baggage, &amp;c., and thrown into a ditch.</p></div></div>

<p class="ph2"><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></p>


<p class="drop">BLÜCHER'S dispositions for the grand Flank movement of his Army towards
the Field on which <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> had announced to him his
intention of accepting Battle from <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, provided he might
calculate on the Marshal's assistance, were fully described in Chapter
VIII. Reconnoitring parties and Patrols had been pushed forward,
early in the day, to feel for the Left of the Anglo-Allied Army, the
communication with which was successfully established. It then became
desirable to explore the ground that lay more to the Right Front of the
Prussians, in the direction of the Right Flank of the main French Army,
in order to ascertain the nature of any precautionary measures adopted
by <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> to impede the junction of the Allied Commanders.
Major <span class="smcap">Lützow</span>, of the Staff, was sent upon this duty, with a
Detachment of the 2nd Silesian Hussars; and on reaching the Wood of
Paris, he not only found this unoccupied, but discovered that no steps
whatever had been taken by the French to cover and secure their Right
Flank. A Prussian Troop of Hussars advanced beyond the Wood of Paris,
to a point near Frischermont, whence it had a good view of both the
French and Allied dispositions and movements; and where it was not even
menaced by the approach of any hostile party.</p>

<p>As Major <span class="smcap">Lützow</span>, fully alive to the importance of speedily
occupying the Wood of Paris, was returning to communicate the above
intelligence to the Prince, he met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span> General <span class="smcap">Grolman</span>, the
Quartermaster General of the Army, to whom he immediately represented
how matters stood: when this Officer directly pushed forward the
Silesian Hussars and two Battalions of Infantry from <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s
Advanced Guard, to take possession of the Wood; these troops having
fortunately just crossed the Defile of St Lambert. <span class="smcap">Grolman</span>
at the same time sent a message to the Prince, suggesting that the
Fifteenth and Sixteenth Brigades should be ordered to follow the
Advanced Guard as soon as they should be collected on the French side
of the Defile.</p>

<p>Great as had been the difficulties hitherto encountered along the
Prussian line of march, the passage of the Defile of St Lambert seemed
to present an almost insurmountable obstacle. The rain which had set in
during the afternoon of the 17th, and had continued without cessation
the entire night, had transformed the valley of the Lasne into a
perfect swamp. The miry and watery state of the roads between Wavre and
St Lambert had caused so many stoppages and breaks in the Columns that
they were frequently lengthened out for miles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blücher</span> showed himself on every point of the line of march,
encouraging his exhausted soldiers, and inciting them to renewed
efforts. The troops, after a short halt to collect their scattered
ranks, entered the Defile. As the ground yielded to their pressure,
both Cavalry and Infantry became dispirited; and when the Artillery
were fairly checked by the guns sinking axle deep, and the men, already
worn down by fatigue, were required to work them out, their murmurs
broke forth in exclamations of&mdash;"We <i>cannot</i> get on."</p>

<p>"But we <i>must</i> get on," was old <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s reply; "I have given
my word to <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, and you will surely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span> not make me break
it: only exert yourselves a few hours longer, children, and certain
victory is ours." This appeal from their venerated Chief was not made
in vain: it served to revive the drooping energies of the wearied, and
to stimulate still further to successful exertion the more robust and
able bodied.</p>

<p>At length, after considerable delay and constant difficulty, the
passage of the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Brigades, as also of the Reserve
of both Cavalry and Artillery, was accomplished; and by four o'clock
these troops had ascended the opposite slope of the valley, and reached
the plateau of the ridge which, constituting the narrow interval
between the Lasne and the Smohain, with a rapid fall on either side
towards those streams, presented a comparatively dry and firm soil
favourable for the further operations of the Prussian forces in this
direction.</p>

<p>As the troops reached the Wood of Paris, they were disposed, with a
considerable front, and in a close compact order, on each side of the
road leading from Lasne towards Planchenoit. The Artillery kept the
road itself; and the Cavalry was drawn up in rear of the Wood, ready to
follow the Infantry.</p>

<p>The Thirteenth and Fourteenth Brigades were expected to join in a
short time; and <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s Corps was following along the same
line. It had been <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s intention to await the arrival
of these troops, and then to debouch with the assembled force; but
having watched the progress of the Battle, he became apprehensive,
on perceiving the tremendous cannonade, and the renewed attack after
four o'clock, that the Enemy might direct a still greater force
against <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Line, and succeed in breaking the
latter before he commenced the attack on his side of the Field. He
could clearly distinguish <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s Reserves, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span> rear of
La Belle Alliance, evidently prepared for being launched against the
Anglo-Allied Line, which had already sustained the most desperate
attacks. The frequent and pressing communications he had received
from the Duke also showed how anxiously the latter relied on his
support. These considerations satisfied the Prince, that the moment had
arrived in which his appearance on the Field would be productive of
consequences the most favourable to the views of his Ally, and the most
influential on the development of their combined exertions; and he now
gave the Order for the attack to commence, even with the small amount
of force then at his disposal, as also for the hastening of the march
of the troops still in the rear.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was half past four o'clock when the Fifteenth and Sixteenth
Brigades debouched from the Wood of Paris; the former on the right,
the latter on the left; and each in the usual Brigade formation for
advance peculiar to Prussian tactics. The direction of the attack was
perpendicular to the Right Flank of the French Army; and consequently,
also, to the Charleroi road, which constituted the French main line of
operation.</p>

<p>In order to cover the Left Flank, Colonel <span class="smcap">Hiller</span>, commanding
the Sixteenth Brigade, detached both the 3rd Battalions of the 15th
Regiment and the 1st Silesian Landwehr, under Major <span class="smcap">Keller</span>, to
keep a look out in that direction as far as the rivulet of the Lasne;
beyond which, Major <span class="smcap">Falkenhausen</span> was scouring the country with
one hundred Horsemen of the 3rd Regiment of Silesian Landwehr Cavalry.</p>

<p>General <span class="smcap">Losthin</span>, commanding the Fifteenth Brigade, detached
three Battalions towards Frischermont and Smohain, to cover the Right
Flank. They were the 2nd Battalion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span> the 18th Regiment, and the 3rd
Battalion of the 3rd Silesian Landwehr, followed by the 1st Battalion
of the former Regiment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Domon</span>'s Cavalry continued drawn up <i>en potence</i>, and was at a
considerable distance from the Prussian Advance, when <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>
ordered a cannonade to open upon it; more with a view to make known his
arrival to the Anglo-Allied Army, and to induce the French to withhold
the employment of a still greater force against the latter, than from
any motive affecting his own immediate operations at the moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Domon</span> now sent forward a Regiment of <i>Chasseurs à Cheval</i> to
attack the Prussian Column, whilst he followed with his whole Line.
Hereupon the 2nd Silesian Hussars and the 2nd Neumark Landwehr Cavalry
moved through the intervals of the Infantry, and formed up in front;
the Hussars to the left, and the Landwehr to the right. They then
advanced, followed by the 3rd Silesian Landwehr Cavalry in support,
and drove back the French <i>Chasseurs</i>; but becoming menaced in flank,
and observing <span class="smcap">Domon</span>'s whole Line advancing, they were, in
their turn, compelled to retire. This movement was covered by the Horse
Battery No. 11; and more particularly by Captain <span class="smcap">Schmidt</span>'s
Foot Battery of the Fifteenth Brigade, which drew up to oppose the
pursuit of the French Cavalry. The vigorous fire which continued to be
maintained by both these Batteries, combined with the advance of the
Prussian Infantry Columns, induced <span class="smcap">Domon</span> to decline following
up his attack at the moment.</p>

<p>The three Battalions already mentioned as having been detached to
the right, had, by this time, reached Smohain. Their advance in that
direction had been conducted with so much caution, that they debouched
from the south-eastern inclosures of the Village most unexpectedly for
both the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span> Allied troops in that vicinity, and the Infantry forming
the extreme Right of the French Front Line. The Prussians continued
to advance; crossed the principal fence which separated them from the
French extreme Right, and drew up in Line almost at right angles with
the direction of the Enemy's front&mdash;two Battalions in Line, with the
third in support. It was half past five o'clock when this took place.</p>

<p>The French at once advanced against them; whereupon the Prussians
retired, and after regaining the hedges in the valley, lined the latter
as Skirmishers, and maintained a vigorous and successful <i>tiraillade</i>
with their opponents.</p>

<p>In the mean time <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, judging from the boldness of
the Prussian Advance, that considerable support was at hand; and
apprehensive, no doubt, of the evil consequence likely to arise from
that Advance, if not promptly and effectually checked, had ordered
the Sixth Corps, under Count <span class="smcap">Lobau</span>, to move forthwith to the
right from its reserve station in rear of La Belle Alliance; and,
in conjunction with <span class="smcap">Domon</span>'s Cavalry, to take up a position
favourable for repelling the attack by which he was menaced on that
side of the Field.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, observing this disposition, the execution of which
was effected with great rapidity and in good order, proceeded to give
a broader and more imposing front to his own troops. He extended his
Right Flank to the wooded Heights of Frischermont, and rested his Left
upon a ravine descending to the Lasne, close to the Wood of Virère.
The Reserve Cavalry, under Prince <span class="smcap">William</span> of Prussia, was put
in motion, in two Columns, towards the Left Flank; on which it was
subsequently formed up.</p>

<p>When <span class="smcap">Lobau</span>'s Corps moved off to the right, the Regiments
of the Old and Middle Guard advanced and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span> took up the position, in
reserve, which it had occupied on the Heights in rear of La Belle
Alliance.</p>

<p>As <span class="smcap">Lobau</span>'s Corps advanced and passed <span class="smcap">Domon</span>'s Cavalry,
the latter was disposed as a Support. Having crossed the valley which,
commencing from the ridge above Planchenoit, on the north side of the
Village, descends towards Smohain, he opened a brisk fire from his guns
upon <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Line. A spirited cannonade ensued, in the course
of which the Prussian Foot Battery No. 14 had three guns disabled.</p>

<p>It was not long, however, before the remaining Brigades of
<span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Corps, the Thirteenth and Fourteenth, came up. Their
Batteries hastened to the front, and materially increased the force of
the Prussian fire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, who had now the whole of <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Corps
at his disposal, was bent upon following up his original intention
of directing his attack against the Enemy's Rear. With this view
he made the Sixteenth Brigade take ground to its left, and brought
up the Fourteenth Brigade in its rear, as a Support; whilst at
the same time he supplied the place of the former in the Line by
posting the Thirteenth Brigade on the left of the Fifteenth. General
<span class="smcap">Hacke</span>, who commanded the Thirteenth Brigade, detached the
1st and 3rd Battalions of the Second Neumark Landwehr to the right,
in support of the troops in Smohain. A portion of this Detachment
occupied Frischermont, thus obtaining an <i>appui</i> for the Prussian Right
Flank, and securing the communication with the Prince of <span class="smcap">Saxe
Weimar</span>'s Brigade, posted along the inclosures in front of the
extreme Left of the Anglo-Allied Army. This Flank was also covered by
the West Prussian Uhlans and the 2nd Neumark Landwehr Cavalry, that
had been detached from the Reserve Cavalry of the Fourth Corps under
Prince <span class="smcap">William</span> of Prussia; which was following, as a Support,
the Left Wing of <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span> Line, now advancing in the direction
of Planchenoit. The Artillery along the Prussian Line had by this time
assumed a formidable appearance, the following Batteries of the Corps
having come successively into action,&mdash;the twelve pounder Batteries
Nos. 3 and 5, the six pounder Batteries Nos. 2, 13, 14, and 21, and the
Horse Batteries Nos. 11 and 12&mdash;comprising altogether sixty four guns.</p>

<p>The ground over which <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Corps was now in the act of
advancing, was highly favourable for the development of a force
destined to attack the Flank of an Army, the Front of which was so
completely <i>aux prises</i> with the Enemy as was that of the French at
this moment. Nearly at all points it commanded the position occupied by
the French Right <i>en potence</i>; the Line was remarkably well <i>appui'd</i>
on the Flanks; and its Front was parallel with the Enemy's main line of
operation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The force which <span class="smcap">Lobau</span> had at his disposal was greatly inferior
to that of the Corps he was sent to oppose. The former amounted to
fifteen Battalions, twenty one Squadrons, and forty two guns&mdash;the
latter (exclusive of the six Battalions and eight Squadrons detached to
the right) consisted of thirty Battalions, twenty seven Squadrons, and
sixty four guns. He could not present a Front sufficiently extensive
and compact that would secure him from being turned in either Flank.
Hence, when he perceived that the principal force in this well planned
attack was advancing from the Prussian Left, in the direction of
Planchenoit, which then lay in his right rear, unoccupied by any French
troops; he felt the necessity of retiring towards the Charleroi road,
which he did by withdrawing his Brigades <i>en échiquier</i>.</p>

<p>It was not long before several round shot from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span> Prussian Batteries
reached the Charleroi road; some of them falling both in front and rear
of La Belle Alliance, where <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> was then stationed. It
was evident to the latter that, unless reinforcements were despatched
in support of <span class="smcap">Lobau</span>, his Right Flank, already so seriously
menaced, would speedily be turned. His trusty Guard with which, in
former Campaigns, he had so frequently succeeded in stemming the
current that had suddenly set in against him from some previously
hidden source and threatened to overwhelm him, constituted the sole
Reserve at his disposal. Engaged during so many hours in carrying on a
desperate attack along his whole Front, without having as yet secured
one single point of vantage ground; he clearly foresaw that without
some vigorous effort, by aid of a powerful Reserve, no ray of victory
would ever gleam upon his arms on that side of the Field. But now that
he was also engaged in defensive operations along his Right, against
another Enemy, by whom even his Rear and the main line of his retreat
became endangered; the necessity of employing a portion of this Reserve
in a direction different from that which he had contemplated, was alike
obvious and urgent.</p>

<p>The appearance of <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Left bearing down upon Planchenoit,
turning <span class="smcap">Lobau</span>'s Right; and the powerful Batteries along the
Prussian Front admirably disposed in accordance with the favourable
nature of the ground, over which the whole Line was gradually
approaching; distinctly indicated the immediate possession of that
Village in force, as the true and only measure that could be adopted
for averting the impending danger. The two Divisions of the Young
Guard, posted on the plateau on the right of the <i>chaussée</i> close
to Rosomme, and consisting of four Battalions of <i>Voltigeurs</i>, and
four Battalions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span> <i>Tirailleurs</i>, were the nearest at hand for the
occupation of Planchenoit; and <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> accordingly desired
General <span class="smcap">Duhesme</span> instantly to march thither with that force,
accompanied by twenty four pieces of cannon of the Guard, and place
himself on the right of <span class="smcap">Lobau</span>'s Corps.</p>

<p>It was about this time (six o'clock) that <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> replied
to <span class="smcap">Ney</span>'s demand for fresh Infantry, <i>Ou voulez vous que j'en
prenne? Voulez vous que j'en fasse?</i> an expression, the force of which
is rendered sufficiently obvious by the critical circumstances of his
position.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was also at this period that <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> received intelligence
that <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span> was attacked by a superior force at Wavre,
and that it was doubtful whether he would be able to maintain his
ground. But the determination of the Prince to carry out his present
plan of attack was fixed and irrevocable. He saw clearly that it was
on the Field where he himself stood that the fate of the Campaign must
be decided; and that by giving the fullest effect in his power to the
combined operation which he had preconcerted with <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>,
and which was already developing itself with so fair a prospect of
success, he was pursuing the right and only course by which the main
Army of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> could be overthrown&mdash;a course founded upon
the leading principle of all strategy, that of bringing the greatest
mass to bear upon the decisive point. He immediately gave Orders that
<span class="smcap">Thielemann</span> should be directed to hold out as well as he could,
and to dispute every inch of ground with his opponents. At the same
time, he desired <span class="smcap">Bülow</span> to continue pressing forward with his
Left, and to gain possession of the Village of Planchenoit.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Hiller</span>, who commanded the Sixth Brigade,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span> formed
the latter into three Columns of Attack. Two Battalions of the 15th
Regiment, under Major <span class="smcap">Wittig</span>, marched on the right against
the Village; two Battalions of the 1st Silesian Landwehr, under Major
<span class="smcap">Fischer</span>, in the centre; and two Battalions of the 2nd Silesian
Landwehr, under Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Blandowsky</span>, formed the Left
Column. The Fourteenth Brigade followed as a Reserve, sending forward
the 1st Battalions of the 11th Regiment and 1st Pomeranian Landwehr as
a Support to the Columns of Attack.</p>

<p>In the mean time the troops of the Young Guard had occupied
Planchenoit, and made their dispositions for its defence. As the
Skirmishers that preceded the Prussian Columns approached the eastern
inclosures of the Village, they were received with a most destructive
fire by the French <i>Tirailleurs</i>. Some pieces of Artillery were also
brought to bear directly upon the Columns; which, nevertheless,
advanced with great bravery and steadiness, captured a howitzer and
two guns, and gained possession of the Churchyard. The occupation of
this spot, which is naturally strong, being inclosed within a low
stone wall, strengthened nearly all round by a steep outer bank, and
commanding by its elevated position a very considerable portion of the
Village, appeared to offer great security to the Prussian troops; but
the Young Guard, evidently prepared for this contingency, flew to the
surrounding houses and gardens, whence they opened a concentrated fire
upon the possessors of the Churchyard. To this the latter replied with
great spirit; and as the distance by which the hostile parties were
separated was extremely limited, numbers fell in rapid succession on
both sides. At length the French Supports having come up and joined in
this contest, and one of the Columns having shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span> itself in rear of
the Prussians; the latter were compelled to abandon the advantages they
had acquired, and to withdraw altogether from the Village.</p>

<p>They were followed by some of <span class="smcap">Lobau</span>'s Cavalry; which, however,
having fallen into the line of fire of the Prussian Battery, No. 2, was
forced to retire.</p>

<p>The Prussian troops that had been driven out of Planchenoit immediately
rallied and reformed. The 2nd Battalions of the 11th Regiment and 1st
Pomeranian Landwehr now joined their respective 1st Battalions, which
had previously acted in support of the attacking Columns, and advanced
to a second assault, followed by the 15th Regiment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, perceiving the determination of the Prussian
Commander to persevere in his attack upon Planchenoit, as also his
dispositions for completely turning the French Right, ordered General
<span class="smcap">Morand</span>, Colonel in Chief of the <i>Chasseurs à pied</i> of the Old
Guard, to march to the Village with a Battalion from each of the 2nd
Regiments of Grenadiers and <i>Chasseurs</i>. These Battalions reached the
scene of action just as the Prussians had re-entered the Village; and
taking the lead in the contest, succeeded in driving them out of the
place, pursuing them as far as their main position on the opposite
Heights. Here the French Skirmishers penetrated amongst the Prussian
Batteries; but were overthrown and cut up by the 4th Squadron of the
2nd Silesian Hussars. The French Cavalry now showed a disposition to
advance; and it was not long before a Regiment of Lancers, which took
the lead, was attacked and defeated by the 8th Prussian Hussars. In
following up the pursuit, however, after their charge, the Hussars were
suddenly involved in the fire from a Battalion of French Infantry, and
were forced to fall back. On the other hand, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span> Regiment of French
<i>Chasseurs à Cheval</i> was driven off in a similar manner by a Prussian
Battalion.</p>

<p>By the advance of the Sixteenth and Fourteenth Brigades against
Planchenoit, a vacant space had been created in the Prussian Line
between those troops and the Thirteenth and Fifteenth Brigades, which
still maintained their ground with great gallantry, in the open Field
on the right. This vacant space was now covered by the main body of
the Reserve Cavalry of <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Corps, commanded by Prince
<span class="smcap">William</span> of Prussia; which by its perfect steadiness and good
countenance, not only induced the Enemy to confine himself to the
defensive, but advanced in support of the Prussian Infantry, even in
the midst of the opposing musketry fire, and here occupied the place
which, had the Line been complete, would have been held by Infantry.
On this occasion, the loss of the Prussian Cavalry was considerable.
The Brigadiers, Colonel Count <span class="smcap">Schwerin</span>, and Lieutenant Colonel
<span class="smcap">Watzdorf</span>, were killed. The latter although previously wounded,
would not quit the Field; and was soon afterwards struck by a shot
which deprived the Prussian Army of a very distinguished Officer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, observing preparatory dispositions for a renewal
of the attack on Planchenoit by <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>, who was only waiting
for the co-operation and support of <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s Corps which
was now rapidly approaching, deemed it advisable to send a further
reinforcement to the troops in the Village. This consisted of the 1st
Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of the <i>Chasseurs</i> of the Guard, under
General <span class="smcap">Pelet</span>; to whom he represented the great importance of
maintaining possession of Planchenoit. At the same time, Orders were
sent to the 1st Battalion of the 1st Regiment of the <i>Chasseurs</i> of
the Guard, which was with the Emperor's baggage at Caillou, to march
to the Wood of Chantelet, for the purpose of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span> covering the right of
Planchenoit, and securing the Village from being turned.</p>

<p>The situation of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> had become critical in the
extreme. The Prussian attack seemed to be checked for the moment;
and the occupation of Planchenoit in sufficient force held out the
prospect of a protracted, if not a successful, struggle in that
quarter, should the attack be renewed. Still it must have appeared
sufficiently evident to the Emperor that <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> was but
awaiting either the arrival of an additional portion of his Army,
or the favourable moment when he might combine his attack with a
simultaneous one by <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>. Should the Prussian General
succeed in defeating the troops comprising the French Right <i>en
potence</i>, <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s line of retreat by the Charleroi road
would be completely intercepted, and his main Front Line being thus
taken in Flank and Rear, would become an easy prey to the Anglo-Allied
Army. He might yet attempt a skilful retreat upon Nivelles; but with
an Army so exhausted by its repeated and ineffectual attacks upon
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s unshaken Line, this would have been a hazardous
operation.</p>

<p>It is, moreover, very questionable whether the idea of retreat ever
entered into his views; for a retreat, after such sacrifices had
been made, harassed and interrupted as it undoubtedly would be by
the two hostile Armies which had succeeded in effecting a junction,
must prove no less disastrous than a signal defeat, and equally
involve the downfall of his military and political power. Hence his
desperate resolve to peril the fate of his brave Army and of his
resuscitated Empire upon another and a final struggle for victory over
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>; whose troops had, with such truly heroic courage
and such inflexible endurance, successfully withstood the most furious
attacks which he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span> repeatedly launched against them during the whole
day. By a victory alone, no matter how dearly purchased, could he hope
to keep alive the national enthusiasm which he had again awakened: but
which would assuredly relapse into irrecoverable apathy, should the
<i>prestige</i> of returning glory be torn from the idol of the military
portion of his subjects, and the Empire become again exposed to be
overrun by those foreign legions that had once more taken up arms with
a firm resolve finally to crush a power, the existence of which was
incompatible with the security and independence of the States of Europe.</p>

<p>As the prospect of the consequences of failure thus flashed across his
mind; <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, like a desperate gambler, driven to his last
stake, determined to risk his all upon another venture. The meditated
blow was to be struck against his bold antagonist, <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>;
whose Line was to be attacked along its entire Front by a simultaneous
effort, while its Right and Centre were to be forced at all hazards.</p>

<p>He immediately ordered General Count <span class="smcap">Druot</span> to collect all
his Battalions of the Guard that were still in reserve, in front of
La Belle Alliance. These were accordingly moved forward from their
position near the house of <span class="smcap">De Coster</span>; and the two Battalions
of the 1st Regiment of Grenadiers, which had previously been stationed
on the Height in rear of La Belle Alliance, were now destined to form a
Reserve to the attacking Columns.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D'Erlon</span> and <span class="smcap">Reille</span> were at the same time ordered to
advance the whole of the remaining disposable force against the Enemy,
with a view to second the main attack. The Centre of the Anglo-Allied
Line, immediately in rear of La Haye Sainte, was not to be allowed a
moment's respite from the attacks which continued to be made against it
by the troops occupying, and debouching from, that Farm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span> These were
also to carry the Centre by assault, as soon as the Guard should reach
the Height.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, who seemed to have acquired a thorough insight
into his opponent's designs, having satisfied himself that his
position was destined shortly to be again assailed by a formidable
force, became anxious for the arrival of the Prussian troops expected
on his extreme Left. He desired his Aide de Camp, Lieutenant Colonel
<span class="smcap">Fremantle</span>, to proceed immediately in that direction, to hasten
the advance of any Corps he might fall in with, and to represent to its
Commander that if he would supply him with the means of strengthening
those points along his Line which had been so seriously weakened by
repeated attacks, he entertained no doubt of not only maintaining his
ground, but of also gaining the victory.</p>

<p>Although the Duke was fully aware that <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Corps was in
active operation against the extreme Right of the French Army, the
ground upon which that operation was mainly carried on was too remote
from his own immediate sphere of action to admit of his calculating
upon support from it, beyond that of a diversion of the Enemy's forces;
and it was only from the high ground on which the extreme Left of the
Anglo-Allied Line rested, that a general view could be obtained of the
Prussian movements. As regards, however, the Village of Planchenoit
itself, the spire of the church was all that could be seen even from
the point alluded to; so that it was scarcely possible to distinguish
which was the successful party in that quarter. <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> might
(as he really did) present an efficient check to the Prussian attack,
and at the same time retain sufficient force wherewith he might make
another vigorous assault upon the Anglo-Allied Army.</p>

<p>When, therefore, the Duke beheld his Line so fearfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span> reduced in
numbers, which he had no means of replacing, and which the indomitable
courage of his British and German troops alone had hitherto been able
to supply, it is not surprising that he should have manifested some
little impatience for the arrival of that portion of the Prussian
forces which was to co-operate more immediately with his own Army. The
latter, with the exception of the Dutch-Belgian troops, which still
continued in reserve, for it was useless to place them where they would
be exposed to the brunt of the battle shock, presented but a mere
wreck of that proud array which it had displayed in the morning. But,
if the vain confidence of strength had departed, the more noble pride
of unflinching bravery still remained unshaken. Exposed, however, as
they had been for so many hours to a tremendous cannonade, which only
ceased at times but to give place to attacks of Cavalry and musketry;
their exemplary passive forbearance seemed, in some instances, to be
approaching its utmost limits. Frequent messages reached the Duke from
Commanding Officers, soliciting reinforcements and support since their
Corps were reduced to skeletons; but the only reply they received was,
that no reinforcements could be granted, and that they must hold their
ground to the last man. Occasionally too, as he rode along the Line, a
murmur would reach his ear, indicative of impatience to be led against
the Enemy. This would draw from him some encouraging appeal, such as
"Wait a little longer, my lads; and your wishes shall be gratified."</p>

<p>In all three Arms of the Service the losses had been awfully severe.
Battalions, dwindled to mere handfuls of men, were commanded by either
Captains or Subalterns. A vast number of guns along the whole extent of
the Line had been disabled. The British and German Cavalry Brigades,
with the exception of <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s and <span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span>'s
on the Left,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span> were reduced to less than the ordinary strength of
Regiments&mdash;<span class="smcap">Somerset</span>'s and <span class="smcap">Ponsonby</span>'s Brigades united
did not comprise two Squadrons. Many, it is true, had quitted the
ranks to assist the wounded, and to convey prisoners to the rear; but
if amongst these were to be found the weak and faint hearted, the
brave spirits that remained nobly represented the valour and devotion
which, under the guidance of a master hand, were destined to be crowned
with lasting triumph. Familiarised as the men had become with scenes,
in rapid succession, of violent death under almost every variety
of aspect, from the sudden gush of life to the slow and lingering
anguish&mdash;from the calm and tranquil sleep "that knows no waking,"
to the ghastly writhings of convulsive death throes&mdash;the short and
frequent command of "Close up!" as their comrades fell around them, was
as mechanically obeyed as would have been any common parade order in a
Barrack Square.</p>

<p>Such was the situation of the troops against which <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>
was meditating an assault with all the force he could collect, in the
hope&mdash;his last and only hope&mdash;of seeing his Eagles soaring in triumph
over those Heights upon which the British Standard continued to wave in
proud defiance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Battalions of the Imperial Guard which had been collected in front
of La Belle Alliance, and which were to constitute the leading feature
in the general attack upon the Anglo-Allied Line, consisted of nine
Battalions, exclusive of the two Battalions of the 1st Regiment of
Grenadiers, destined, as previously observed, to remain as a Reserve.
These nine Battalions were formed into Two Columns of Attack. The First
comprised four Battalions of the Middle Guard, namely, the 1st and
2nd Battalions of the 3rd Regiment of Grenadiers, and the 1st and 2nd
Battalions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span> the 3rd Regiment of <i>Chasseurs</i>. It was formed in mass
of Battalions, and destined to advance against the Centre of the Right
Wing of the Anglo-Allied Army.</p>

<p>The Second Column of Attack consisted of the three remaining Battalions
of the Middle Guard&mdash;namely, the 1st Battalion of the 4th Regiment
of Grenadiers, and the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 4th Regiment of
<i>Chasseurs</i>&mdash;and of two Battalions of the Old Guard, namely, the 1st
and 2nd Battalions of the 1st Regiment of <i>Chasseurs</i>. These five
Battalions were moved down into the hollow adjoining the south-eastern
angle of the inclosures of Hougomont, and there formed into a Column in
mass, which was to support the First Column, and to direct its advance
somewhat more to the left.</p>

<p>In rear, and on the right and left, of these Columns, stood the remains
of that splendid Cavalry, with which <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Line had
been so furiously and so perseveringly assailed, occupying the interval
that had been continually augmenting between <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s and
<span class="smcap">Reille</span>'s Corps. They formed the last and only Cavalry Reserve
remaining at <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s disposal, for following up the attack
by the Guard, should the latter prove successful; or for covering its
retreat, in the event of failure.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was shortly before the Columns of Attack were put in motion that
<span class="smcap">Vivian</span>, whose Hussar Brigade it will be recollected, was
posted upon the extreme Left of the Anglo-Allied Line, was informed
by Patrols which he had detached to look out to his left for the
expected arrival of the Prussians, that the latter were advancing in
force along the road from Ohain. Having satisfied himself as to the
fact, and perceiving their Advanced Cavalry coming on, <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>
felt that there could be no longer any apprehension of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span> Left of
the Army being turned: and having previously understood from Sir
<span class="smcap">William Delancey</span> and other Staff Officers, that fresh Cavalry
was much wanted in the Centre; he proposed to <span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span>,
who was on his right, and who was his senior Officer, that the two
Brigades should move towards the Centre, where they might be of
service. <span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span> declined to act without Orders: whereupon
<span class="smcap">Vivian</span> put his own Brigade in motion, passing along the
rear of <span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span>'s, and soon after having commenced his
march he met Lord <span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span>; who was much pleased to find
that the Duke's wishes had thus been anticipated, and sent Orders to
<span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span> to follow, accompanying the former Brigade himself
towards the Centre, passing along the foot of the slope in rear of the
position of the Left Wing of the Anglo-Allied Line.</p>

<p>The Prussian troops, whose advance had thus induced <span class="smcap">Vivian</span> to
quit the extreme Left, were the Advanced Guard of <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s
Corps: and consisted of a part of the First Infantry Brigade, namely,
the 3rd Battalion 12th Regiment, the 1st and 2nd Battalions 24th
Regiment, the 3rd Battalion 1st Westphalian Landwehr, and the 1st
and 3rd Silesian Rifle Companies; as also of a part of the Reserve
Cavalry, namely, the 1st Silesian Hussars, the Brandenburg Uhlans, the
Brandenburg Dragoons, and the 2nd Kurmark Landwehr Cavalry.</p>

<p>They had already been joined by Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Fremantle</span>,
who delivered to <span class="smcap">Zieten</span> the Duke's message: in reply to which
that General remarked that he did not feel himself authorised to detach
his Corps in the manner proposed; adding, however, that the great mass
of the Prussian Army was arriving upon the Field.</p>

<p>The remainder of the Reserve Cavalry which was commanded by Lieutenant
General <span class="smcap">Röder</span>, together with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span> the main body of the Corps,
were still considerably in the rear. They were met by Captain
<span class="smcap">Jackson</span> of the British Staff Corps, who had been sent to look
for them. These troops did not reach the Field of Battle until after
the victory had been decided.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, finding that there was no chance of his shattered
Line being strengthened by the arrival, in sufficient time, of a
Prussian force from his left, to support his weak points of defence;
and that he must therefore depend solely on his own resources for
the means of warding off the desperate blow which <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>
was about to strike, immediately made such dispositions as the
circumstances of the moment appeared to him to demand. The incessant
attacks made by the French Light Troops debouching from La Haye Sainte,
from the moment that Farm fell into their possession, had caused great
havoc in the Centre of his Line, where the want of reinforcement became
most apparent. To meet this deficiency, he ordered the Brunswick
Battalions, which stood at this time in rear of <span class="smcap">Maitland</span>'s and
<span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s Brigades&mdash;namely, the 2nd and 3rd Light, and the 1st,
2nd, and 3rd Line, Battalions, to move by their left into the interval
between <span class="smcap">Halkett</span>'s British, and <span class="smcap">Kruse</span>'s Nassau,
Brigade.</p>

<p>To occupy the ground thus vacated by the Brunswickers, he put in
motion <span class="smcap">d'Aubremé</span>'s Dutch-Belgian Infantry Brigade from its
recently assumed position in rear of the Nivelles road; whence the
other Brigade of <span class="smcap">Chassé</span>'s Dutch-Belgian Division, under Major
General <span class="smcap">Ditmer</span>, was shortly afterwards ordered to move in the
direction of the left of <span class="smcap">Maitland</span>'s British Brigade.</p>

<p>The remains of his Cavalry stood in rear of the Centre; towards which
<span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s and <span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span>'s Brigades were now moving
from the Left, as previously explained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span></p>

<p>Whilst the Imperial Guard was forming for attack, the French troops
in possession of La Haye Sainte and its inclosures, now consisting
of the entire of <span class="smcap">Donzelot</span>'s Division, from the Left of
<span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s Corps, renewed, with redoubled vigour, their assault
upon the Centre of the Allied Line: the object being evidently either
to force that point previously to the arrival of the Guard on its
left, and thus facilitate the assault to be made by the latter; or to
harass it in such a manner that, should the effort of the Guard prove
successful, they would be enabled completely to overthrow the Allied
Centre. The fire from the Skirmishers that had located themselves
between the Farm and the position, and from those on the Knoll by the
Sand Pit on the opposite side of the high road, had been incessant
since the capture of that Post.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ompteda</span>'s Brigade of the King's German Legion, which had
hitherto occupied the hollow way that descends into the <i>chaussée</i>,
was reduced to a mere handful of men: the two Squares in which
<span class="smcap">Kielmansegge</span>'s Hanoverian Brigade, the next on the (Allied)
Right, had stood its ground so many hours, were fearfully diminished;
<span class="smcap">Kruse</span>'s Nassau Brigade, still further to the right, formed
in three Contiguous Columns (two in front and one in rear), began
to evince symptoms of hesitation; and the interval between this and
<span class="smcap">Halkett</span>'s British Brigade had become much greater than was
consistent with the due security of this part of the Line. So weakened
indeed was the latter at this period, that, to remedy the evil in some
degree, it had been deemed advisable, with a view rather of giving it
the appearance of greater strength than of affording any very active
support, to draw close up in its rear, the skeleton remains of the
Scots Greys and of the 3rd Hussars of the King's German Legion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span></p>

<p>On the Allied left of the high road, an unremitting fire was maintained
against their opponents by the 95th and 4th British Regiments in
extended order along the front hedge of the Wavre road, commencing
from the Charleroi <i>chaussée</i>, as also from the 40th, 79th, 1st, and
28th British Regiments, deployed behind the embanked hedge on the
rear side of that road. The 27th British Regiment had been brought
up by <span class="smcap">Lambert</span>, and posted, in Square, in the angle formed
by the junction of the above roads: having one face parallel with,
and close to, the <i>chaussée</i>, for the purpose either of throwing a
flank fire upon the French troops on the opposite side, should these
succeed, as appeared very probable, in compelling <span class="smcap">Ompteda</span>'s
and <span class="smcap">Kielmansegge</span>'s Brigades to retire; or, of pouring a close,
deadly volley upon any Column endeavouring to penetrate along the
high road itself. The Artillery on the Allied right of the high road,
in front of these Brigades, was at this moment completely disabled.
Two British Artillerymen were observed vainly endeavouring to serve
a couple of guns, but were compelled to desist from the want of all
material for loading.</p>

<p>Such was the state of things in the Centre of the Anglo-Allied Army,
when the continued popping fire from the French Skirmishers suddenly
quickened into a fierce <i>tiraillade</i> which threatened to bear down
every thing opposed to it. The bank along the high road, beyond the
Garden of La Haye Sainte, and the mound adjoining it, which latter
was quite close to the Allied position, became all at once thickly
crowded with Skirmishers. Those that lined the banks seemed intent upon
keeping down the fire from the British Regiments of <span class="smcap">Kempt</span>'s
and <span class="smcap">Lambert</span>'s Brigades, along the Wavre road; while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span> those
under cover of the little mound in advance, as if aware of the object
of the formation of the 27th British Regiment, and sensible of the
necessity of securing their Right Flank in their meditated forcing of
the position, opened such a close, sharp, fire upon that Regiment that,
within the brief space of a few minutes, it lost more than half of its
numbers.</p>

<p>At the same time, taking advantage of the crippled state of the Allied
Artillery in this quarter, the French brought up two guns in advance
of the north-western angle of the Garden of La Haye Sainte, in which
position they were covered from any fire from the opposite side of the
high road by the Skirmishers occupying the bank and the mound. From
these guns a smart fire of grape was opened, and maintained without
intermission, upon the Left Square of <span class="smcap">Kielmansegge</span>'s Brigade
(consisting of the Field Battalions Grubenhagen and York), at the short
distance of one hundred and fifty, and afterwards of scarcely one
hundred, paces. The Square manifested the most exemplary submission and
forbearance, notwithstanding the ravages that continued to be made in
its ranks; not venturing to reply to the fire, by the apprehension of
Cavalry being under the brow of the position, prepared to take instant
advantage of any favourable opportunity for a charge. The Right Square
(consisting of the Field Battalions Bremen and Verden) also suffered
most severely.</p>

<p>Some other guns, which had accompanied the Columns in rear of the
French Skirmishers, were suddenly brought forward, and opened so
destructive a discharge of grape upon this latter Square, that one of
its sides was literally completely blown away; the remainder being
left standing in the form of a triangle. The Commander, and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
other Officers, were wounded. The ammunition was failing rapidly. The
combined fire of grape and musketry continued to increase in violence;
and the Square finally dwindled into a mere clump of men. The French
<i>Tirailleurs</i> continued pressing forward in a very compact line, whilst
the sound of drums beating the <i>pas de charge</i> announced the advance of
the Columns immediately in their rear.</p>

<p>The Prince of <span class="smcap">Orange</span>, perceiving the probability of the
Centre of the Allied Line being forced, unless some great effort were
made to check the Enemy's advance, ordered the 1st and 2nd Nassau
Battalions of <span class="smcap">Kruse</span>'s Brigade to charge, gallantly placing
himself at their head. His Royal Highness was soon struck by a bullet
in the left shoulder; the attack failed; and the Nassauers were falling
back, when the reinforcement which <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> had provided
for this part of the Line, consisting of five Battalions of Brunswick
Infantry, moved rapidly into the interval between <span class="smcap">Kruse</span>'s
Nassau, and <span class="smcap">Halkett</span>'s British, Brigades. But so unexpectedly
did the Brunswickers find themselves placed under a most destructive
fire, and so suddenly were the heads of their Columns assailed, that
they were unable, in the midst of the thick smoke in which they became
involved, to recover from the partial irregularities by which, under
such circumstances, their advance was accompanied, and to form up in
sufficient order, before they came in close contact with the Enemy:
whose vigorous attack compelled them, as also <span class="smcap">Kruse</span>'s,
<span class="smcap">Kielmansegge</span>'s, and <span class="smcap">Ompteda</span>'s Brigades, to fall back
about a hundred paces.</p>

<p>At this critical moment, <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> hastened to the spot in
person, to avert so alarming a catastrophe as that of having his Centre
broken, at a time, too, when he was preparing to receive a formidable
attack, directed against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span> another point of his Line, situated at but
a short distance on the right of that Centre. He addressed himself to
the Brunswickers; and succeeded, by the electrifying influence of his
voice, gesture, and presence, in rallying the discomfited Columns. The
3rd Line Battalion, under Major <span class="smcap">Normann</span>, was the first to
reform in good order: it then boldly stood its ground; and, when the
Enemy's Infantry approached, received it with so destructive a fire as
completely to check its further advance.</p>

<p>By dint of example and encouragement on the part of all the Commanding
Officers, the Brigades on the left of the Brunswickers were also
rallied and formed up: upon seeing which, the Duke galloped off to the
right.</p>

<p>Just at this time, <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s Hussar Brigade drew up immediately
in rear of these troops&mdash;relieving the exhausted remains of the Scots
Greys and 3rd Hussars of the King's German Legion&mdash;the 10th and 18th
British Hussars in Front, and the 1st Hussars of the King's German
Legion in Second, Line. The presence and appearance of this fresh
Cavalry tended very considerably to restore confidence to that part
of the Line. The Brigade had previously, in consequence of a mistake
in the transmission of Orders, been halted on the left of the high
road about midway between the Front Line and the Farm of Mont St Jean;
whence, however, it was speedily brought forward, and posted as above,
by Lord <span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span>.</p>

<p>The Prince of <span class="smcap">Orange</span>, <span class="smcap">Alten</span>, and almost all the
superior Officers of the Third Division, had been wounded. But
<span class="smcap">Kielmansegge</span>, who now commanded in this part of the Field,
was fully alive to the critical circumstances under which the Third
Division was placed; and exhibited great ability, coolness, and
determination, by the manner in which he succeeded in restoring it
to order. Still, the persevering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span> and incessant <i>tiraillade</i> kept
up against these troops by the French was such that the fire thrown
out from their shattered and enfeebled ranks was quite inadequate to
repress it. The French Skirmishers again crowded close up to the Line;
maintaining a most rapid and destructive fire.</p>

<p>The Allied Infantry was once more on the point of giving way. One
Battalion of the Brunswickers was retiring in Close Column, but in
good order; having totally exhausted its ammunition. The Nassauers
were falling back <i>en masse</i> against the horses' heads of the
10th Hussars; who, keeping their Files closed, prevented further
retreat. <span class="smcap">Vivian</span> and Captain <span class="smcap">Shakespeare</span> of the 10th
(acting as his extra Aide de Camp), rendered themselves conspicuous
at this moment by their endeavours to halt and encourage the
Nassauers. The Hanoverians and the German Legion on the left, led by
<span class="smcap">Kielmansegge</span>, now resolutely dashed forward, at the double
quick&mdash;their drums rolling. The Enemy fell back. The Brunswickers took
up the movement, as then did also the Nassauers&mdash;<span class="smcap">Vivian</span> and
his Aide de Camp cheering them on; whilst the Hussars followed in close
support. In this manner, <span class="smcap">Kielmansegge</span> succeeded in leading
back the shattered remnants of the Division to the place they had so
long and so honourably occupied on the ridge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s Brigade, by its proximity to these troops, against
which so close and unremitting a fire of musketry was maintained, was
placed in a very trying situation for Cavalry, and suffered much in
consequence. As soon, however, as the Infantry had rallied and resumed
their former position in the Line, <span class="smcap">Vivian</span> withdrew his Brigade
under the crest of the ridge, a distance of not more than thirty yards,
to place his men a little out of fire; and when thus posted, he was
better prepared to make an attack if required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span></p>

<p>The fire from the Enemy's Infantry in front of this part of the Line
suddenly slackened; and it was soon manifest that they were falling
back: the change arose out of occurrences on their left, which will be
explained in the next Chapter.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span></p>




<p class="ph2"><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></p>


<p class="drop">IT was during the fierce and desperate conflict just described as
having taken place in the Centre of the Anglo-Allied Line, that the
French Imperial Guard moved forward to the attack; and this was the
signal for the simultaneous advance of all the disposable Battalions of
<span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s and <span class="smcap">Reille</span>'s Corps.</p>

<p>In the preliminary pause which occurred in the fire from the French
Batteries, from the first moment of the advance until the Columns had
sufficiently descended from the Heights to be below the range of their
guns, the thunder of <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Artillery upon the French extreme
Right, and of the guns brought to bear against it, was so distinctly
audible that <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, apprehending its evil effects upon
the troops on whose bravery, discipline, and devotion, his fate now
hung, despatched Aides de Camp along the Line to spread the false
intelligence of the arrival of <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>; and to declare that
it now required but a little firmness to secure the victory to which
they were advancing. The loud shouts with which this announcement was
received by the troops, who had then descended below the range of the
guns, were speedily drowned in the roar that burst forth from the
entire Line of the French Batteries.</p>

<p>The effects of this terrific cannonade upon the skeleton ranks of the
Allied Front Line, combined with the aspect of the advancing hosts,
tended not in the slightest degree to shake that noble and unequalled
courage with which the British and German troops had hitherto sustained
every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span> assault. The scene of havoc and devastation which met their view
as they looked around them, the constant ravages which they had been
destined passively to endure for so many hours, their ranks repeatedly
torn open and their Files scattered asunder, as shot and shell plunged
in amongst them,&mdash;all conduced to excite in the breasts of men of such
impenetrable mould a feeling of exultation and relief, as they observed
the approach of the Enemy's Infantry, and panted for the long wished
for moment when they might grapple with their deadly foe at close
quarters, in a hand to hand encounter. Most fully did they realise
the expectations entertained of them by their Enemy, but admirer, the
brave General <span class="smcap">Foy</span>; who had felt it his duty, prior to the
commencement of the Battle, to declare to the Emperor, that His Majesty
had an Infantry opposed to him which he had never known to yield.</p>

<p>The French troops, perceiving their whole Front Line in motion, felt
conscious that the final struggle was at hand, and assured that the
varied fortunes of the day were to be wound up by some splendid
triumph. The Guard proudly took the lead in this grand attack&mdash;that
sacred cohort, whose glory had ever shone conspicuously when a
great crisis summoned forth those energies by which its valour and
its prowess had acquired for it imperishable renown. The greatest
enthusiasm reigned amidst the devoted defenders of the Imperial
diadem; which was now to be strengthened by the fame of their renowned
successes, and adorned with fresh wreaths of never fading laurels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, nervously anxious to strain to its utmost tension,
the daring spirit and high resolve which animated his troops, galloped
forward to the inner gentle slope of the eminence on the left of the
Charleroi road, which, overlooking the Farm of La Haye Sainte, formed
the most prominent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span> point of his whole Line, and by which was to pass
the leading Column of the Guard, there to strengthen, by the magic
spell of his immediate presence, the link which bound their fortunes
to his own fate, and to the destiny of the Empire. As they approached,
he pointed significantly to the Allied position; a gesture which drew
forth renewed shouts of "<i>Vive l'Empereur!</i>" The fond regards which he
seemed to cast upon these, his old and tried campaigners, and the air
of confidence he assumed, as he contemplated their advance; rivetted
upon him the affectionate gaze of the devoted band, to hundreds of whom
it proved the last look upon the idol for whom they were to sacrifice
their lives.</p>

<p>At this time, <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s Corps presented an advance of Columns
in <i>echelon</i> between the Charleroi road and its Right Flank which was
engaged with the Prussians: whilst <span class="smcap">Reille</span>'s Corps, descending
in Columns, some into the Wood, others into the inclosures on the
right, and some also still more to the right, outside of Hougomont,
and close upon the Centre of the Line, seemed bent upon carrying that
Post by main force; and upon seconding, with one mighty effort, the
main attack by the Imperial Guard. This general advance of Columns
was preceded by a host of Skirmishers, whose Line spreading along the
valley in front of <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s Corps, gradually became engaged
with the Light Troops of the Left Wing of the Anglo-Allied Army; and
the sudden impulse given to the rattle of musketry in the Wood of
Hougomont betokened that the brave defenders of this Post were already
engaged in a renewed and desperate struggle for the maintenance of its
possession.</p>

<p>The French Skirmishers between the Wood of Hougomont and the extreme
Left of their Army, continued to maintain a desultory warfare with
the Allied Light Troops in the front, consisting of the 3rd Regiment
of British Guards, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span> Light Companies of the 14th and 23rd British
Regiments, and six Companies of the 51st British Regiment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Piré</span>'s Light Cavalry Brigade was still in the position it had
occupied upon the extreme Left of the French Front Line, having a few
Vedettes thrown out; which were narrowly watched by those belonging to
Captain <span class="smcap">Wodehouse</span>'s Squadron of the 15th British Hussars.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As the leading Column of the Imperial Guard began to ascend the
slightly inclined tongue of ground that projects from that part
of the ridge of the Duke's position in rear of the crest of which
<span class="smcap">Maitland</span>'s Brigade of Guards was lying down at the time, it
became very much exposed to the concentrated fire from nearly all the
Batteries of the Anglo-Allied Right Wing, by which the most frightful
havoc was dealt amidst its devoted ranks. The Line of Skirmishers
which preceded it, now pushed rapidly and boldly forward up to the
very summit of the Duke's position; for the purpose both of concealing
by their veil of smoke the precise direction of the advance of the
Columns, and of driving away the Artillerymen from their guns by the
fire of which the Guard was suffering so severely.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the terrible havoc made in the ranks of the leading
Column of the Imperial Guard, it continued its advance in admirable
order and with the greatest enthusiasm. Several of its superior
Officers placed themselves at its head. <span class="smcap">Ney</span>'s horse having
been shot under him; he drew his sword, and chivalrously led the
way on foot, sustaining to the last his appropriate and well earned
<i>nom de guerre&mdash;le plus brave des braves</i>. General <span class="smcap">Friant</span>,
who commanded the Grenadiers, fell severely wounded. General
<span class="smcap">Michel</span>, Colonel <i>en second</i> of the <i>Chasseurs</i>, was killed
a few moments afterwards. The fall of the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span> occasioned some
hesitation&mdash;the 1st Battalion of the 3rd Regiment of Grenadiers halted;
but at the call of General <span class="smcap">Poret de Morvan</span>, who commanded
it, it renewed its advance at the <i>pas de charge</i>, amidst loud shouts
of "<i>Vive l'Empereur!</i>" As the Column neared the rise of ground which
constituted the highest point of the ridge occupied by the Right Wing
of the Duke's Line, it gradually passed the line of fire hitherto
directed upon it by the greater portion of the Batteries on the British
right of that point.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wellington</span> rode up to the British Foot Battery posted on the
immediate right of <span class="smcap">Maitland</span>'s Brigade of Guards, with its own
Right thrown somewhat forward, and addressing himself to an Artillery
Officer (Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Sharpin</span>), hastily asked who commanded
it. The latter replied that Captain <span class="smcap">Bolton</span> having just been
killed, it was now under the command of Captain <span class="smcap">Napier</span>.
The Duke then said, "Tell him to keep a look out to his left, for
the French will soon be with him." The message had scarcely been
communicated when the bearskin caps of the leading divisions of the
Column of the Imperial Guard appeared just above the summit of the
hill. The cannonade hitherto directed upon this point from the distant
French Batteries, now ceased; but a swarm of Skirmishers opened a
sharp and teasing fire among the British Gunners. In the next moment,
however, they were scattered and driven back upon the main body by a
sudden shower of canister, grape, and shrapnel shells, poured forth
from <span class="smcap">Napier</span>'s guns; which now kept up a terrific fire upon the
Column, within a distance of forty or fifty yards. Nevertheless the
French Guards continued to advance. They had now topped the summit. To
the astonishment of the Officers who were at their head, there appeared
in their immediate front no direct impediment to their further advance.
They could only distinguish dimly through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span> smoke extending from
<span class="smcap">Napier</span>'s Battery, the cocked hats of a few mounted Officers;
little imagining, probably, that the most prominent of these was the
great Duke himself. Pressing boldly forward, they had arrived within
fifty paces of the spot on which the British Guards were lying down,
when <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> gave the talismanic call&mdash;"Up, Guards; make
ready!" and ordered <span class="smcap">Maitland</span> to attack. It was a moment of
thrilling excitement. The British Guards springing up so suddenly in a
most compact four deep line, appeared to the French as if starting out
of the ground. The latter, with their high bonnets, as they crowned the
summit of the ridge, appeared to the British, through the smoky haze,
like a Corps of giants bearing down upon them.</p>

<p>The British Guards instantly opened their fire with a tremendous
volley, thrown in with amazing coolness, deliberation, and precision.
An oblique fire was also poured in among them from the 33rd and 69th
British Regiments, which <span class="smcap">Halkett</span> had most promptly and
judiciously pushed forward to the immediate Left of the Guards at this
critical moment. The head of the Column became, as it were, convulsed
by the shock, and nearly the entire mass staggered under the effect. In
less than a single minute more than three hundred of these brave old
warriors fell, to rise no more. But the high spirit and innate valour
which actuated the mass were not to be subdued by a first repulse.
Its Officers, placing themselves conspicuously in its Front and on
its Flanks, called aloud, waved their swords; and, by encouraging
words and gestures, commenced a deployment in order to acquire a more
extended front. But the head of the Column being continually shattered
and driven back upon the mass, by the well sustained and rapidly
destructive fire by which it was assailed within so extremely limited
a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span> space, this attempt altogether failed. The Front of the Column was
becoming momentarily more disordered and broken up; men were turning
round and disappearing by the Flanks, whilst others in the rear began
firing over the heads of those before them.</p>

<p>The confusion into which the French Guards had now been thrown became
manifest. The Duke ordered <span class="smcap">Maitland</span> to charge; whilst, at the
same instant, the gallant Lord <span class="smcap">Saltoun</span>, equally alive to the
real situation of the Column, called out, "Now's the time, my boys!"
The Brigade sprang forward, with a loud cheer, to the charge. Numbers
of the French Guards nearest to the British, threw down their arms and
knapsacks, and dispersed. The Flanks began rapidly to spread out; and
then the mass partaking more generally of the panic, appeared as if
rent asunder by some invisible power.</p>

<p>During the advance of the attacking Column of the Imperial Guard, one
of its Battalions had moved out from the mass to its right (probably
for the better security of that Flank from any attempt that might be
made to molest it from the dip or hollow on that side of the projecting
tongue of ground along which the main attack had proceeded), and took a
direction which brought it immediately in front of <span class="smcap">Halkett</span>'s
Left Wing, consisting of the shattered remnants of the 30th and 73rd
British Regiments, formed in a four deep line, scarcely exceeding,
if equalling, in extent (such had been their losses), the front of
the approaching Column. The order in which this Column advanced was
admirable. Its formation was undisturbed by the fire of Artillery,
of which Arm there was none in this part of the Field in working
condition; and, as it pressed on with the compactness and regularity of
a parade movement, it appeared at the same time to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span> animated with
the best spirit. Presently the Column halted and fired; and, in return,
received a well directed volley; after delivering which, the 30th and
73rd Regiments ported arms, and, with a loud cheer, dashed forward at
the charge. On reaching the ground where they expected to meet the
French Guards, they were greatly astonished at discovering, through the
clearing smoke, that their recent opponents were flying in a mass.</p>

<p>At this moment, Major <span class="smcap">van der Smissen</span>'s Dutch-Belgian Horse
Battery, which had just come up by the right of <span class="smcap">Halkett</span>'s
Brigade, opened upon them a terrific fire from which they suffered
immensely.</p>

<p>The British Guards had continued their charge some distance down
the slope of the hill; when <span class="smcap">Maitland</span> perceived the Second
attacking Column of the Imperial Guard advancing on his right, and
exposing his Brigade to the imminent risk of being turned on that
flank. He accordingly resolved to face about the Right Wing of his
Brigade, and to give the words, "Halt, front," as soon as he had
got his Line parallel with the front of the advancing Column. This
man&oelig;uvre was executed with great regularity and precision by the
Right Wing, with which <span class="smcap">Maitland</span> was immediately present, and
which he had well in hand. But amidst their victorious shouts, and
the noise of the firing of cannon and other arms, the command was
imperfectly understood by the Left Wing: and the first sense of danger
led to a cry of "Form Square" being passed along their Line, it being
naturally assumed that the Enemy's Cavalry would take advantage of
their isolated position; which, however, was not the case. The Flanks
of the 3rd Battalion, of which this Left Wing was composed, gave way as
if to form Square. <span class="smcap">Saltoun</span> conspicuously exerted himself in
endeavouring to rectify the mistake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>, but in vain; and the whole of the
Battalion went to the rear.</p>

<p>The confusion in which they retired was unavoidable; but it was not
the confusion consequent upon either defeat or panic: it resulted
simply from a misunderstanding of the command; and no greater or more
distinguished proof could be afforded of the excellent order, cool
self-possession, and admirable discipline of these troops, than the
steadiness, alacrity, and intelligence with which, upon regaining
the crest of the ridge, they obeyed the command then given of "Halt,
front, form up;" mechanically resuming their four deep formation, and
instantly darting forward at the double quick, to their proper place
on the left of the 2nd Battalion, so that the whole Brigade was now in
one steady and compact Line; parallel with the front of the advancing
Second attacking Column of the Imperial Guard.</p>

<p>How marked a contrast did such conduct on the part of the British
Guards, who thus, in the Battle's front, so gloriously upheld
their country's honour, offer to that of a considerable body of
the Allied troops then posted in Second Line as their Support!
<span class="smcap">D'Aubremé</span>'s Infantry Brigade of <span class="smcap">Chassé</span>'s
Dutch-Belgian Division, which, as before stated, had been moved into
the space in rear of <span class="smcap">Maitland</span>'s Brigade, previously occupied
by the Brunswickers, was now formed into three large Squares, of two
Battalions each. These troops, on hearing the loud shouts of the Second
advancing Column of the French Imperial Guard&mdash;of that very Column
which had been moving in rear of the British Guards while the latter
were retiring from their triumphant charge towards their original
position&mdash;became so unsteady, and evinced so decided a disposition to
quit their ranks, that <span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span>, whose Brigade of British
Light Dragoons was at this time drawn up in their rear, deemed it
advisable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span> to close his Squadron intervals, the better to impede
their contemplated retreat; and was induced, along with his Major of
Brigade, Major <span class="smcap">Childers</span> of the 16th Light Dragoons, Captain
<span class="smcap">Tomkinson</span> of the same Regiment, and several of his Officers,
on perceiving that the Squares were on the point of giving way, to dart
forward and endeavour, partly by menaces, and partly by exhortations,
to induce them to maintain their ground. The Dutch-Belgian Officers
exerted themselves in restoring order and confidence; but their men
were evidently bent upon abandoning their position in this part of the
Field. Between them and the attacking Column intervened the crest of
the main ridge, occupied by the Duke's First Line; the latter holding
out to them a bright example of perfect discipline, of unflinching
steadiness, and patient endurance. Of the attacking Column itself they
could see absolutely nothing; but its shouts alone seemed sufficient
to scare them off the ground! Besides, they had but just entered the
immediate Field of Action, and had not hitherto been engaged with the
Enemy; whereas the British Brigade of Guards had been exposed during
eight hours to an incessant cannonade, and to numerous and desperate
attacks of both Cavalry and Infantry. Of such materials was composed
the Duke's Second Line in rear of the main point of attack by the
French Army at this, the most critical moment of the whole Battle!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Second attacking Column of the French Imperial Guard, which,
as before explained, had been formed in the hollow adjacent to the
south-east angle of the Hougomont inclosures, advanced in a line
parallel with, and at a very short distance from, the hedge forming
the eastern boundary. On reaching the foot of the British position,
however, the Column diverged a little to its right, either to take
advan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>tage of a slight undulation of the ground which seemed to offer
a partial cover from the tremendous fire of Artillery that continued
to pour upon it, or solely for the purpose of directing its advance
upon the point at which it perceived the First attacking Column
was engaged, and at which it might be better enabled to follow up
any success that Column might obtain. Between the heads of the two
attacking Columns there was a distance, during their advance, of from
ten to twelve minutes' march. Whether this difference in the time of
their movement was intentional, or arose from a misunderstanding in the
conveyance of Orders, or from any other accident, is uncertain; but it
is quite evident that, by forming two separate attacks, they subjected
themselves to the imminent risk of being defeated in detail&mdash;a risk
which, as will be presently shown, was speedily converted into a
reality.</p>

<p class="caption">Battle of Waterloo</p>



<p>The Second, like the First, Column of Attack, advanced with great
boldness, and in excellent order, and appeared animated by the best
possible spirit. Its Left Front was covered by a cloud of Skirmishers,
in order to conceal its movement as much as possible from the view of
the British Line. The Battalions of <span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s Brigade threw out
each a Company for the purpose of checking them. During the advance of
the Column, and more especially as it descended the gentle declivity
eastward of the Great Orchard of Hougomont, it suffered severely from
the British cannonade. So destructive indeed had been the fire from
some of the British Batteries on the right of <span class="smcap">Maitland</span>'s
Brigade, from the commencement of the advance of the Imperial Guard,
that the French were at length induced suddenly to push forward a body
of <i>Cuirassiers</i> to endeavour to silence these guns. In this they
partially succeeded; the <i>Cuirassiers</i> having gallantly charged one of
the Batteries, and forced the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span> Gunners to seek shelter in the rear of
the Infantry&mdash;driving in, at the same time, the Skirmishers of the 2nd
Battalion of the 95th Regiment, and those of the 52nd Regiment. They
were checked, however, by the to them sudden and unexpected appearance
of <span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s Brigade, which had just been moved, in its four deep
line, close up to the narrow road that runs along the summit of the
ridge. The 52nd Regiment, which was more directly opposed to them, came
down to the "Prepare for Cavalry!"</p>

<p>As a renewal of the attack seemed probable, a Squadron of the 23rd
British Light Dragoons, under Captain Cox, was detached across the
ridge, down the outer slope, towards the Great Orchard; from the rear
of which it charged the <i>Cuirassiers</i> as they advanced again towards
the guns, overcame them, and pursued them across the plain, far in rear
of the Second attacking Column of the Imperial Guard, until it fell
into a fire thrown out upon it from the head of a French Column of
Infantry, by which its Files were scattered, and the whole compelled to
make a hasty retreat towards the Allied position.</p>

<p>Had the Second Column of Attack continued in the original direction
of its advance, it would have come upon the centre of <span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s
Brigade: but having, as it began to ascend the exterior slope of the
main ridge of the Allied position, slightly diverged to its right, as
before observed, by following the direction of a very gentle hollow,
constituting the re-entering angle formed by the tongue of ground
that projected from the front of <span class="smcap">Maitland</span>'s Brigade, and
that part of the ridge occupied by <span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s Brigade, it, in
some degree, lent its Left Flank to the latter. This circumstance was
not only observed, but had been in a great measure anticipated, by
Lieutenant Colonel Sir <span class="smcap">John Colborne</span>, commanding the 52nd
Regiment, an Officer of great repute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span> in the British Army. He had been
watching with intense anxiety the progress of the Enemy's Column; and,
seizing the most favourable moment, he, without Orders, and upon his
own responsibility, wheeled the Left Company of the 52nd to the left,
and then formed the remainder of the Regiment upon that Company, for
the purpose of bringing its front nearly parallel with the Flank of
the French Column. At this moment <span class="smcap">Adam</span> rode up, and asked
<span class="smcap">Colborne</span> what he was going to do; to which the latter replied,
"to make that Column feel our fire." <span class="smcap">Adam</span>, approving of this,
ordered <span class="smcap">Colborne</span> to move on; and galloped off to bring up his
Right Regiment, the 71st.</p>

<p>The Duke, who had just seen <span class="smcap">Maitland</span>'s Brigade reformed and
posted in the best order, parallel with the front of the attacking
Column, was at this moment stationed on the right of <span class="smcap">Napier</span>'s
Battery. He despatched an Aide de Camp (Major the Hon. <span class="smcap">Henry
Percy</span>) to direct Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Clinton</span> to advance and attack
the Imperial Guard: but a single glance at <span class="smcap">Colborne</span>'s forward
movement satisfied him that his intention had been anticipated; and he
immediately pushed forward the 2nd Battalion of the 95th Regiment to
the left of the 52nd.</p>

<p>The head of the French Column had by this time nearly reached the brow
of the ridge, its front covering almost the whole of <span class="smcap">Napier</span>'s
Battery, and a portion of the extreme Right of <span class="smcap">Maitland</span>'s
Brigade. It was still gallantly pressing forward, in defiance of the
most galling fire poured into its front by the Battery and by the
British Guards, when the sudden and imposing appearance of the four
deep line of the 52nd Regiment bearing directly towards its Left Flank
in the most admirable and compact order imaginable, caused it to halt.
In the next instant, wheeling up its Left Sections, it opened a rapid
and destructive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span> fire from the entire length of its Left Flank against
the 52nd Regiment. <span class="smcap">Colborne</span>, having brought his Line parallel
to the Flank of the Imperial Guard, also halted, and poured a deadly
fire into the mass; and, almost at the same moment, the rifles of the
2nd Battalion 95th Regiment, then coming up on the left, were levelled
and discharged with unerring aim into the more advanced portion of the
Column. The 71st Regiment was, at this time, rapidly advancing on the
right, to complete the Brigade movement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colborne</span>, eager fully to carry out his projected Flank Attack
upon the Enemy's Column, caused his men to cease firing, and then gave
the command, "Charge! charge!" It was answered by three hearty British
cheers that rose distinctly above the shouts of "<i>Vive l'Empereur!</i>",
and the now straggling and unsteady fire from the Column. The 2nd
Battalion 95th Regiment hastened to join in the charge on the left.
The movement was remarkable for the order, the steadiness, the
resoluteness, and the daring, by which it was characterised. The Column
of the Imperial Guard, which already seemed to reel to and fro under
the effect of the front and flank fire which had been so successfully
brought to bear upon it, was evidently in consternation as it beheld
the close advance of <span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s Brigade. Some daring spirits&mdash;and
it contained many within its ranks&mdash;still endeavoured to make at
least a show of resistance; but the disorder, which had been rapidly
increasing, now became uncontrollable: and this Second Column of the
Imperial Guard, breaking into the wildest confusion, shared the fate of
the First; with this difference, however, that in consequence of the
combined front and flank fire in which it had been so fatally involved,
and of the unrestrained pursuit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span> which deprived it of the power of
rallying its component parts, it became so thoroughly disjointed
and dispersed that, with the exception of the two rear Battalions
which constituted the 1st Regiment of <i>Chasseurs</i> (Old Guard), it
is extremely doubtful whether any portion of it ever reunited, as a
regularly formed military body, during the brief remaining period of
the Battle&mdash;certainly not on the Allied side of La Belle Alliance,
towards which point it directed its retreat.</p>

<p>It is necessary to remark that this Regiment of the Old Guard, which
was commanded by General <span class="smcap">Cambronne</span>, formed a separate Column
of Support in <i>echelon</i> to, and immediate left rear of, the three
Battalions of the Middle Guard: but so close to each other were the
two Columns, that although an interval was observed between them by
<span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s Brigade when the latter stood in the general Front Line
of the Allied position, they appeared to it but as one Column, when
charged in flank; and may, to all intents and purposes, be considered
as having formed one general Column of Attack. <span class="smcap">Cambronne</span>'s
Battalions, however, forming the rear of the Column, did not become
exposed to the fire from <span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s Brigade; inasmuch as neither
the 71st Regiment nor the 2nd Battalion 95th Regiment could complete
the Brigade flank movement in time to open a fire upon the mass before
the actual charge was commenced. Hence, although they turned, along
with the rest of the Column; yet, unlike the latter, they retained a
considerable degree of order.</p>

<p>Troops could scarcely be placed in a more critical situation than was
this Second attacking Column of the Imperial Guard from the moment it
came to a halt. With its Front immediately facing a Battery within
sixty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span> or seventy yards' distance, the double shotted guns of which
continued ploughing through the mass, and tearing up its ranks; with
its Left Flank faced outwards to repel a formidable attack on that
side, and its Right Flank partially exposed to the oblique fire from
the greater portion of the Line of British Guards; the interior of the
mass, enveloped in smoke, feeling a pressure from both Front and Flank,
and yet perceiving no indication of the means of extricating itself
from so perilous a position, it was truly a most trying moment even to
such veteran warriors as those which constituted the renowned Imperial
Guard of France.</p>

<p>Any attempt at deployment to its right, while thus attacked on its
left, was of course out of the question. Had it continued to advance
until <span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s Brigade had approached quite close to its Left
Flank, the charge of the latter must have brought it to a stand, and
rendered the efforts of the head of the Column abortive. If, on the
other hand, after having faced altogether to the Left, and converted
that Flank into a compact Line, it had advanced to meet the 52nd
Regiment when it first became aware of this attack, it would still have
been exposed on the right (its previous Front) to the havoc created
by <span class="smcap">Napier</span>'s guns, as also to a charge by <span class="smcap">Maitland</span>'s
Brigade; which by bringing forward its left shoulders, might have
rendered the situation of the Column so hopeless, as probably to have
led to its immediate and unqualified surrender on the spot.</p>

<p>The dilemma into which these veterans were thus thrown was mainly
attributable to the fatal neglect of not accompanying the Column with
an effective Support of Cavalry. A strong body of the latter on each
Flank, or in its immediate rear, would have secured the Column from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>
any such Flank Attack as that which so successfully arrested its
progress, and so completely effected its dispersion.</p>

<p>The direction given to <span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s Line by its "right shoulder
forward" movement having brought it perpendicular to the general front
of the French position, that Officer became naturally anxious for
support upon his Right Flank, to secure the latter from the Enemy's
Cavalry; which, it was to be presumed, would now be brought forward
from his Reserve, since none of it had been employed in immediate
support of the last attack. He urgently requested for this purpose,
the aid of troops from the other part of <span class="smcap">Clinton</span>'s Division;
and Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Halkett</span>, seeing what was required,
immediately advanced with the nearest Battalion of his Hanoverian
Brigade, the Osnabrück Landwehr, in Column at quarter distance, and
close up in right rear of the 71st Regiment. Thus <span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s
Brigade, maintaining its four deep line, and being flanked by the
Hanoverian Battalion which could form Square at any moment, was secured
against Cavalry.</p>

<p>The confused and disordered mass of the Imperial Guard, from the
first impulse given to it by the flank charge, hastened a short
distance in a direction parallel with that of the Anglo-Allied Line,
and then naturally inclining towards the French position, it fell
into nearly the same track of retreat as that pursued by the First
attacking Column, namely towards the first rise of ground intersected
by the Charleroi road, a little beyond the southern extremity of the
Orchard of La Haye Sainte. As it approached the rear of those Columns
of <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s Corps, which had been so desperately opposing
<span class="smcap">Alten</span>'s Division; the latter became infected with the panic,
and commingled with the flying Guard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s Brigade continued its triumphant advance, at first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
parallel, for a short distance, to the Allied Line; and then, bringing
forward its left shoulders, swept proudly onward in the direction of
the French Height before mentioned; crowds of fugitives hurrying along
and striving to escape from the pursuing wave that seemed every instant
on the point of engulfing them.</p>

<p>During its advance, the front of <span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s Brigade was partially
crossed by the Squadron of the 23rd Light Dragoons, under Lieutenant
<span class="smcap">Banner</span>, retiring in disorder from its charge. Mistaken for
hostile Cavalry, these Dragoons were unfortunately fired upon by the
52nd Regiment; and it was not until the foremost of them had fallen
close upon the bayonets, that the error was discovered.</p>

<p>Immediately after this incident, a fire of grape was opened upon the
52nd by three French field pieces in the prolongation of its Right
Flank. This enfilading of the Regiment in its four deep line was
a judicious measure on the part of the French Artillery, and well
calculated to derange the advance of <span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s Brigade. It
was, however, very gallantly and speedily checked by the wheeling
up and advance of the Right Section of the 52nd, under Lieutenant
<span class="smcap">Gawler</span>; who succeeded in driving off the guns, whilst the rest
of the Regiment continued its pursuit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, as soon as he saw that the success of the charge
by <span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s Brigade was so decisive, requested <span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span>
immediately to launch forward some fresh Cavalry to check the probable
advance of that of the Enemy; and to second the efforts of the Infantry
in front, by boldly attacking the French Reserves, which appeared
collected in front of La Belle Alliance, the critical point of
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s Line.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Lord <span class="smcap">Greenock</span>, Assistant Quarter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span> Master
General of the Cavalry, was despatched to <span class="smcap">Vivian</span> with Orders
for him to move his Hussar Brigade to its right from its position
in rear of <span class="smcap">Alten</span>'s Division, so as to get clear of the
Infantry, and then to advance directly to the front by the right of
<span class="smcap">Maitland</span>'s Brigade of Guards.</p>

<p>At the same time, the Duke turned round to order up the nearest
Supports to the space which had been vacated in his Front Line by
the advance of <span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s Brigade. But what a spectacle met his
view! The three Dutch-Belgian Squares, into which <span class="smcap">d'Aubremé</span>'s
Brigade had been formed, and whose unsteadiness, previously described,
had greatly augmented as the firing and shouting on the exterior slope
of the ridge, of which they could see nothing, became more continuous
and intense, were now in a state bordering on dissolution. The faces of
the Squares were already broken at intervals by groups in the act of
abandoning their ranks; whilst several Officers of <span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span>'s
Brigade, which, as before observed (see pages 526-527), was drawn up
in their rear, were zealously exerting themselves in endeavouring to
induce these troops to stand fast.</p>

<p>The Duke, observing this, called out, "That's right; tell them the
French are retiring." This intelligence, quickly caught up and spread
through their ranks, had the desired effect of restoring them to order.
They shortly afterwards formed into Columns, and advanced to the Front
Line.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In order to preserve a distinct and connected view of the combined
operations against <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, it will be necessary, previously
to describing the General Advance of the Allied Line, consequent upon
the failure of the attack by the French Imperial Guard, to revert to
the movements of the Prussians.</p>

<p>It will be recollected that <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s, and subsequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span>'s, Brigade, quitted the Left of the Anglo-Allied
Line, on the approach of the Advanced Guard of <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Corps
towards that point. Shortly before the arrival of these troops, the
French Skirmishers in front of <span class="smcap">Durutte</span>'s Division, which
constituted the angle of the <i>potence</i> on which stood the extreme Right
of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s Army, having been considerably reinforced,
were pushed forward for the purpose of establishing themselves in
the houses and inclosures in the valley below them; and of impeding,
by this means, the connection between <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Corps and the
Anglo-Allied Left. The Nassauers, of Prince <span class="smcap">Bernhard</span> of Saxe
Weimar's Brigade, fell back from the houses of the Hamlet of Papelotte;
but firmly maintained their ground on the Allied side of the valley,
retaining possession of the Farms of Papelotte and La Haye. The French
Skirmishers, passing further to their right, pressed on to the Village
of Smohain; where they became warmly engaged with the Prussian troops
that had been so judiciously posted in that quarter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, perceiving the Infantry of the Advanced Guard of
<span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Corps upon the Height above Smohain, sent an Order
for its moving by the shortest way to engage the Enemy in the valley.
The Prussian General <span class="smcap">Müffling</span>, attached to the Headquarters
Staff of the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, was at that moment in this
vicinity, and gave the requisite instructions to the Staff Officer sent
forward from <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Corps.</p>

<p>About this time, the Fifth and Sixth Infantry Brigades, as also the
Reserve Cavalry of <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s Corps, reached the Field, in rear
of <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>. <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>, placing himself at the head of his
leading Brigade (the Fifth), immediately conducted it in the direction
of Planchenoit; and, on coming up with the Fourteenth and Sixteenth
Brigades, he began,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span> in conjunction with Colonel <span class="smcap">Hiller</span>,
to make the necessary dispositions for the Third attack upon that
Village. The Sixth Brigade was ordered to follow as a Reserve; and the
attack was to be supported by a simultaneous advance of the Right Wing
of <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Corps against <span class="smcap">Lobau</span>'s Line, which was
exceedingly well drawn up, and exhibited every indication of making
a determined stand. <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> had despatched an Order to the
Seventh Brigade (of <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s Corps) to move together with the
4th Kurmark Landwehr Cavalry, upon Maransart, on the south side of
the Lasne, for the purpose of covering his Left Flank. The remaining
Brigade (the Eighth) of <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s Corps, which had been detained
in consequence of the Rear Guard affair near Wavre, received Orders
from <span class="smcap">Pirch</span> to quicken its advance.</p>

<p>The Reserve Cavalry of <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s Corps was deployed in three
Lines on the right of the Cavalry of the Fourth Corps. The First Line
consisted of the Pomeranian Hussars and the Brandenburg Hussars; the
Second, of the Silesian Uhlans, two Squadrons of the 6th Neumark
Dragoons, and the Queen's Dragoons; and the Third, of the 5th Kurmark
and Elbe Landwehr Cavalry. These Lines of Cavalry thus occupied the
interval between the Wings of <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Corps; and, at the same
time, served to impose, by their display of force, upon the French
Cavalry, under <span class="smcap">Domon</span>, which was then in reserve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, judging the recapture of Planchenoit to be a most
essential aid in the general operations against the French, as
affording the means not only of turning the Right of <span class="smcap">Lobau</span>'s
Corps, but also of molesting the Rear of the French Army, and of
endangering its main line of retreat, ordered the immediate advance of
the troops destined for the Third attack upon that Village.</p>

<p>They were formed in the following order:&mdash;The 2nd and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span> 3rd Battalions
of the 2nd Regiment (Fifth Brigade) made the attack in the direction of
the Church; the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 5th Westphalian Landwehr,
formed into one, were directed upon the French left of the Village;
the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Regiment followed in rear of the central
space between these two Columns; Major <span class="smcap">Witzleben</span> led the 3rd
Battalion of the 25th Regiment (Fifth Brigade) towards the Heights on
the (French) right of the Village; and the remainder of this Regiment,
which had occupied the outer edge of the Wood of Virère on the left,
also advanced. The 11th Regiment and the 2nd Pomeranian Landwehr,
belonging to the Fourteenth Brigade, and the 1st and 2nd Battalions of
the 15th Regiment, with the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 1st Silesian
Landwehr, belonging to the Sixteenth Brigade, followed in support
of this attack. The whole force was disposed in chequered Columns,
preceded by a strong Line of Skirmishers, and covered by the Prussian
Batteries on the Heights in rear.</p>

<p>The Horse Battery, No. 6, posted on the high ground upon the right of
the Wood of Virère, was principally occupied in diverting the fire from
a Horse Battery of the Reserve Artillery of the French Imperial Guard,
which had one half of its guns above the hollow way formed by the road
leading down into Planchenoit from La Maison du Roi, and the other half
detached to an elevated spot in the south part of the Village, whence
it had a commanding view of a considerable portion of the advancing
Columns.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with this Third attack upon Planchenoit, the Thirteenth
and Fifteenth Brigades, which constituted <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Right
Wing, advanced against <span class="smcap">Lobau</span>'s Line, covered by a force of
Artillery much superior to that which the French could bring to bear
against them. They were disposed in chequered Columns of Battalions,
in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span> following manner:&mdash;In Front Line were the 2nd Battalion of the
18th Regiment and the 3rd Battalion of the 3rd Silesian Landwehr; in
the Second Line were the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the 18th Regiment,
the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 3rd Silesian Landwehr, and the 1st
Battalion of the 10th Regiment; in the Third Line were the three
Battalions of the 4th Silesian Landwehr, and the 2nd Battalion of
the 10th Regiment. The three Battalions of the 3rd Neumark Landwehr
followed in reserve.</p>

<p>The Right of this advance was supported by the West Prussian Uhlans and
the 2nd Neumark Landwehr Cavalry.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the First Infantry Brigade of <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s
Corps, having continued its descent into the valley, passing
<span class="smcap">Hacke</span>'s Infantry in and about Smohain on its left, advanced
upon La Haye and Papelotte, and mistaking the Nassauers for French,
through the similarity of uniform, opened a sharp fire upon them,
and drove them from their Post. The latter at first replied to this
fire, which was kept up for some minutes, killing and wounding on both
sides, until the error was discovered. These troops then began pressing
forward, conjointly with those from Smohain, against the French
Skirmishers.</p>

<p>The Advanced Cavalry of <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Corps, which had been seen
approaching the Left of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Line, had now joined. The
Brandenburg Dragoons and Brandenburg Uhlans, drew up in Line in rear of
the Wavre road, and on the immediate Left of <span class="smcap">Best</span>'s Hanoverian
Infantry Brigade. The 1st Silesian Hussars formed upon the outer slope
of the ridge, in rear of the lane leading from the Wavre road down to
Papelotte. The 2nd Kurmark Landwehr Cavalry drew up in the hollow in
the rear of the interval between the Landwehr Battalions Osterode and
Verden of <span class="smcap">Best</span>'s Brigade. It was on the ground immediately in
front of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span> this interval that Captain <span class="smcap">Rettberg</span>'s Hanoverian
Foot Battery had been posted throughout the day: and as the latter
had expended the whole of its ammunition, it withdrew to the rear
as the Prussian Horse Battery, No. 7, came up, by which it was then
relieved; and the Prussians opened a cannonade from this point upon the
opposite Heights. The Prussian Foot Battery, No. 7, quitting the Wavre
road, proceeded some way down the outer slope of the ridge to seek a
favourable point whence it could by its fire cover the advance of the
Infantry in the valley.</p>

<p>Such was the general disposition of <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s forces
relatively with that of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Army at the time when the
latter had defeated the attacking Columns of the French Imperial Guard;
and was following up its triumph by boldly assailing the very Centre of
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s position, at which point the latter had collected
his sole remaining Reserves. Perhaps a more comprehensive view of
this relative disposition of the Prussian troops may be afforded by
simply stating, by way of a summary, that the advanced portion of
<span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Corps had joined the Left of the Allied Line, that
part of <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s Corps (including his Reserve Cavalry) had
joined <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>; and that the latter was on the advance&mdash;his
Right to attack <span class="smcap">Lobau</span>, and his Left to make a Third assault
upon Planchenoit&mdash;the French opposed to them evincing, at all points,
every indication of making a firm and determined stand.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We must now resume the detail of the brilliant and decisive
dispositions of the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, whom we left
triumphantly defeating the French Imperial Guard, and requesting the
Earl of <span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span> to bring forward fresh Cavalry, to aid the
advancing Infantry in taking immediate advantage of the disorder and
confusion into which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span> Enemy had been thrown by the failure of his
last grand attack.</p>

<p>There is not, perhaps, an instance in modern history, in which the
threatening tide of battle, has, through the lightning-like promptitude
of decision, and the energetic application of yet remaining resources,
been so suddenly and powerfully controlled, and so majestically and
irresistibly hurled back, overwhelming all and everything that, in the
previous plenitude of its force it had borne aloft with buoyant hopes,
and carried along exultingly in its course, as it was by the immortal
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span> in this his last, his crowning, victory. Never did
a battle field present so complete, so magical, a transition of scene
as that which succeeded the defeat of the Imperial Guards of France by
the Guards of the Sovereign of England and the British Light Infantry
Brigade.</p>

<p>The state of the Duke's Army at the time of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s last
grand attack has already been adverted to; but let us glance again,
for a moment, at the awfully diminished numbers, and almost exhausted
energies, of those heroic bands which, in Front Line, had been exposed
to the incessant and concentrated cannonade from a range of Batteries
forming almost the entire arc of which that Line was the chord [<i>or
rather</i> forming the chord of which that Line was the arc]; subjected
to repeated and vigorous attacks of all Arms during so many hours; and
now called upon to resist "to the death" another assault more fierce
and determined than any they had yet encountered&mdash;look at the rear
of that Line, and observe the palpable defection in the ranks of an
Ally; whose Contingent, whilst it constituted so great a proportion
of the Duke's entire force, had already afforded too evident proofs
that in a calculation of available resources, its services must be
thrown entirely out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span> scale&mdash;see, too, at increased intervals,
the wrecks of the British and German Cavalry, with, however, the
fortunate exception of the two Light Brigades so opportunely brought
from the extreme Left to the rear of the menaced point of attack&mdash;how
discouraging an aspect, when compared with that of the French Army
advancing to its last grand attack! Is it to be wondered that, at
that moment, doubts as to the issue of the great contest should have
prevailed in the minds even of those who were prepared to support their
noble Chief to the last drop of their blood?</p>

<p>And yet, with such apparently inefficient elements, the bare
contemplation of which might have both weighed down the energies, and
altered the purpose, of another General, did the British Chief not only
successfully defeat this most formidable assault, but finally gain a
signal and resplendent victory. It would, however, be unjust to the
abilities, and to the fame of the Duke, to ascribe such victory solely
to his defeat of the attacking Columns of the Imperial Guard upon his
own position; though such, no doubt, was the foundation upon which
he erected the structure of his final triumph. The nine Battalions
of the Guard, of which the attacking Columns had been composed, were
defeated; but these, it must be borne in mind, constituted but the
<i>Van</i> of the attacking force, which comprised no less than the whole
Front Line of the French Army. <span class="smcap">D'Erlon</span>'s Corps from the
right, and <span class="smcap">Reille</span>'s Corps from the left, were pouring forth
their numerous Columns, the principal portion of which had already
reached more than midway towards the Allied position, and presented a
formidable array; whilst from the Heights which they had quitted, their
Artillery thundered forth as vigorously, over their heads, upon the
exhausted Line of the Allies, as at any previous period of the Battle.</p>

<p>The four Battalions of the First attacking Column of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span> Guard had
been rallied with great rapidity by <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>; and posted on
a commanding eminence, intersected by the Charleroi road in front
of his Centre. Near La Belle Alliance, Reserves had been collected,
principally of Cavalry; and though the latter consisted entirely of
the remains of Corps that had previously suffered great losses, they
might have been wielded with powerful effect against any point at which
the advancing Infantry should succeed in making an impression. Besides
these, there stood on the French extreme Left, a Brigade of Light
Cavalry which had not been engaged during any part of the day, and had
never yet moved out of its position.</p>

<p>On the other hand, too, however glorious the result of the struggle
with the Imperial Guard, it could not but tend to cripple still further
the slender physical means which the Duke yet retained at his disposal.
Victory, hovering over the brave Conquerors of the Imperial Guard,
alighted for a moment at the feet of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>; and ere the
Goddess could be scared away by the still threatening countenance of
the Enemy, Britain's Hero secured her favour by the display of that
extraordinary foresight, prompt decision, and unflinching determination
which, though at all times his distinguishing characteristics, now
shone forth with more than ordinary brilliancy. His perfect knowledge
of the character and composition of the French Army plainly told him
that a signal defeat of the Imperial Guard, a force employed only on
occasions of great and critical emergency, would be certain to exercise
a powerful influence upon the <i>morale</i> of the Enemy's troops; but it
also told him that, unless instant advantage were taken of that defeat,
unless it were followed up in such a manner as to render the incipient
panic which it had created, general and uncontrollable, that same Army
might, through the powerful influence and indefatigable exertions of
such men as <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> and <span class="smcap">Ney</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span> rapidly recover the
shock; <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s and <span class="smcap">Reille</span>'s Columns, although
faltering for a moment, might pursue their advance with determined
efforts to regain the footing which the Guard had lost; the veterans
composing the latter force, resolved to avenge their defeat, might
speedily rally, and, with desperate resolution, renew their attack,
aided by a more direct and effective support by the Cavalry Reserves
collected in front of La Belle Alliance.</p>

<p>This view had scarcely passed across the mind of the Duke, when his
decision was fully made. With those critically slender means, to which
allusion has more than once been made, and which in the hands of many
a Commander would have been deemed totally inadequate for even the
maintenance of the position, at such fearful odds, <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>
determined to compensate for the awfully reduced and exhausted state of
the fighting portion of his troops, and the utter want of confidence
in the remainder, by one of those bold and daring acts, which,
when hazarded at the right moment, carry with them the <i>prestige</i>
of conscious superiority, and allow an Enemy no time to discover
deficiencies, or to calculate mischances.</p>

<p>No sooner was the Second attacking Column of the Imperial Guard
defeated and dispersed, than he ordered it to be vigorously pursued,
and the rallied force of the First Column to be attacked, by
<span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s Brigade; whilst at the same moment he launched forth
<span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s Hussar Brigade against the Cavalry Reserves near La
Belle Alliance, before these had made their dispositions for attack,
and even before they had recovered from the surprise and hesitation
which prevailed amongst them on witnessing the discomfiture of the
Guard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vivian</span>, the moment he received the Order to advance, wheeled
his Brigade, Half Squadrons to the right. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span> the 10th Hussars became
the leading Regiment, the 18th Hussars followed, and the 1st Hussars
of the German Legion, which had stood in Second Line, moved off, as
soon as its front was clear, in rear of the latter Corps. The Brigade
proceeded, at a trot, a short distance in rear of the Infantry, and
parallel to the crest of the position; and, as it approached the right
of <span class="smcap">Maitland</span>'s Brigade of Guards, <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>, ordering the
leading Half Squadron to wheel to the left, through <span class="smcap">Napier</span>'s
Battery, led it perpendicularly to the front. As the Column thus
advanced across the ridge, in Left Front of <span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span>'s
Light Cavalry Brigade, it was saluted by the latter with cheers of
encouragement; and in a similar manner by <span class="smcap">Maitland</span>'s Brigade
of Guards as it passed their Flank. The smoke lay heavily along the
entire position; and especially, at this moment, over that part of
the exterior slope of the ridge on which the struggle with the French
Imperial Guard had taken place, and across which <span class="smcap">Vivian</span> was
now leading his Brigade.</p>

<p>On advancing further, and getting clear of the smoke, he obtained a
more distinct view of the dispositions of the Enemy's forces in his
direct front. A very considerable portion appeared in great confusion;
disordered Columns of Infantry were hurrying back to the main position,
up the slope, on which were numerous stragglers of all Arms, and in
various uniforms, mixed together and retiring in crowds. Guns were
firing from different points to cover the retreat, and the discharge of
musketry in and about Hougomont continued very brisk.</p>

<p>On arriving about midway towards the Enemy's position, well formed
bodies of troops were observed on the French left of La Belle Alliance,
posted as if fully prepared to resist the threatened attack. They
consisted of two Squares of Infantry, with Cavalry and guns formed on
the Flanks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span> and between them. The Cavalry on their left was somewhat
advanced, comprising separate bodies, partially covering one another,
but presenting a general front, and posted on some rising ground about
two hundred yards on the Allied left of the south-east angle of the
Hougomont inclosures. The two Squares here alluded to were the two
Battalions of the Grenadiers of the Old Guard, which had been placed
in reserve of the main attack by that force as previously explained.
The Cavalry on the left was thus disposed&mdash;first, on the slope of the
little eminence, a portion of the Lancers of the Imperial Guard; then,
in left rear of the latter, on lower ground, were two Squadrons of the
Dragoons of the Guard, and, in their right rear, two more Squadrons
of the same Corps; in right rear of these again, and on the summit of
the eminence, stood the Brigade of Carabiniers. In rear of these, and
of the Squares themselves, as also on the right of the latter, were
collected the remainder of that portion of the French Cavalry which
had made such repeated attacks upon the Duke's Line during the day.
All these different bodies of Cavalry were but mere wrecks of their
former selves&mdash;Regiments, and, in many instances, entire Brigades, were
diminished to less than Squadrons. In the morning, as they came fresh
into the Field, they constituted the flower of the French Cavalry; now,
so severe had been their losses, they presented a mere phantom of their
former splendour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vivian</span>, as soon as he perceived this disposition of the
Enemy's forces in his immediate front, decided upon forming a Front
Line with the 10th and 18th British Hussars, and upon holding the 1st
Hussars of the German Legion in Second Line, in support. For this
purpose, and also with a view to oppose, and, if possible, to turn,
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span> Left of the Enemy's Cavalry, he made the leading Regiment, the
10th Hussars, incline to its right.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, <span class="smcap">Vivian</span> was joined by Colonel Sir <span class="smcap">Colin
Campbell</span> of the Staff, who brought him an Order from the Duke
that he was not to attack before the Infantry came up, unless he felt
confident of success. <span class="smcap">Vivian</span> remarked that as the Allied
Infantry in its anxiety to get on, was probably not in compact order,
its safety might be seriously endangered should it be exposed to a
Cavalry attack; and that, in his opinion, it would be better that not
a moment should be lost on his part in driving off the Cavalry which
appeared in his front. Sir <span class="smcap">Colin Campbell</span> coincided in this
opinion, and returned to the Duke.</p>

<p>After the very short pause at the head of the Column, consequent upon
this little discussion, <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>, continuing the advance,
ordered the 10th Hussars to form Line on the front Half Squadron, and,
at the same time, sent Orders to his two other Regiments also to form
Line on their leading Half Squadrons respectively, but then to remain
in support. The rapid pace which had been maintained by the head of
the Column, and the incline to the right which had been given to it,
required great activity on the part of the Left Half Squadrons to get
up into Line; and as <span class="smcap">Vivian</span> ordered the charge as soon as the
first Squadron was formed, it was executed not in Line but rather in
<i>echelon</i> of Squadrons, which, under the circumstances of the moment,
as will presently be seen, was the preferable and more desirable
formation.</p>

<p>Just as the charge was ordered, the 2nd Light Dragoons of the King's
German Legion, in a Column of Squadrons, which had been detached
from the main position, almost simultaneously with the advance of
<span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s Brigade, came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span> up on the right of the 10th Hussars,
and in a direction rather crossing the front of the latter Regiment,
which had its left thrown somewhat forward whilst the Germans were
moving straight to their front, and directly upon the French Dragoons
of the Guard before mentioned as posted in the hollow on the Allied
right of the eminence on which stood the French Cavalry about to be
charged by <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s Brigade. The Dragoons at first appeared
disposed to resist the Germans, and received them with a tolerably
effective carbine fire from their rear ranks; but the former charged
home, cut down several of the Enemy's horsemen, and made some
prisoners. In following up the charge, however, the Regiment exposed
its Right Flank to a body of <i>Cuirassiers</i>, by which it was thrown into
disorder. Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">de Jonquières</span>, the Commanding
Officer, ordered the halt and rally to be sounded; but in the next
moment he was wounded, as was also Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Maydell</span>.</p>


<p class="figcenter" ><img src="images/illus26.jpg" alt="cap" />
<a id="illus26" name="illus26"></a></p>
<p class="caption">Battle of Waterloo</p>



<p>Major <span class="smcap">Friedrichs</span>, who was next in command, highly
distinguished himself on this occasion by the spirited manner in which
he rallied several of his men together; and as those that had been
dispersed, rapidly placed themselves on his flanks, and thus extended
his new Line, he made another charge, which sent the Enemy's Cavalry
about, and put it to flight. The Regiment then continued moving
forward, with proper caution, along the base of the higher ground on
the left, over which the 10th British Hussars were also charging and
advancing.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the latter Regiment made its charge: the Right,
Centre, and Left Squadrons, in rapid succession, dashed in amongst
the French Cavalry posted as before mentioned. The Left Squadron of
the 10th had scarcely closed with the Enemy, before the whole of the
Cavalry on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span> the (French) left of the Squares of the Guard, was in
full flight. <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>, perceiving the complete success of this
brilliant charge, ordered a halt; and then returned as quickly as
possible to the 18th Hussars.</p>

<p>After the 10th Hussars had pursued the French Cavalry about two
hundred yards, a body of <i>Cuirassiers</i> charged their Right Squadron,
on its Right Flank, and forced it about a hundred yards away to
the left, whilst the Centre and Left Squadrons not being aware of
<span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s Order to halt continued their pursuit, inclining to
their right, under Lieutenant Colonel Lord <span class="smcap">Robert Manners</span>,
then commanding the 10th.</p>

<p>Previously to describing the subsequent proceedings of this Brigade, it
is necessary to revert to other matters in order to connect them with
the general disposition of the main Army.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s Light Infantry Brigade had, in the mean time, been
steadily advancing from the moment of its charge upon the Left Flank
of the Second attacking Column of the French Imperial Guard, sweeping
along the front of the Right Centre of the Anglo-Allied position,
and bringing forward its left shoulders as it neared the Charleroi
road, so that its Left skirted the Orchard of La Haye Sainte. It had
now reached the hollow immediately under the nearest French Height
which was intersected by that road, and upon which the troops that
had composed the first attacking Column of the Guard had been rallied
by <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, and formed into three Squares. The 2nd Regiment
of <i>Chasseurs</i> of the Old Guard having formed the extreme Left of
the attacking force had been closely observed by Lieutenant Colonel
<span class="smcap">Halkett</span>, who continued to follow it very steadily with the
Osnabrück Landwehr Battalion as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span> it retired towards the high road,
inclining to La Belle Alliance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, perceiving the confusion in which the Columns
of the French Imperial Guard fell back after the decided failure of
their attack&mdash;a confusion which was evidently extending itself with
wonderful rapidity to a vast portion of the troops in their vicinity
who witnessed their discomfiture; remarking also the beautiful
advance of <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s Hussar Brigade against the French
Reserves posted close to La Belle Alliance, and in the very heart of
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s position; as well as the steady and triumphant
march of <span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s Brigade, which, driving a host of fugitives
before it, had now closely approached the nearest rise of the French
position contiguous to the Charleroi road; finally, observing that
<span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s movement upon Planchenoit had begun to take effect,
perceiving the fire of his cannon, and being also aware that part of a
Prussian Corps had joined his own Left by Ohain,&mdash;he ordered a General
Advance of the whole of his Line of Infantry, supported by the Cavalry
and Artillery.</p>

<p>As this long wished for command rapidly passed along the Line, loud
and joyous were the shouts with which it was received. The passive
endurance, not unaccompanied by murmurs, with which the Allied troops
had, during so many hours, withstood the incessant attacks of Cavalry,
Infantry, and Artillery, to which so vast, so awful, a proportion of
their comrades had fallen a sacrifice, now gave place to feelings of
intense exultation, of intoxicating triumph. At the same time, when
they saw that the Advance was general, that the Enemy had retired in
confusion from his last grand attack, and that the Brigades detached
to the front were boldly assailing his Reserves, the conviction
flashed across their minds that if the Duke had hitherto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span> resisted
their demands to be led to the attack, his consummate and unerring
judgement had caused him to defer the advance until that attack could
be undertaken with every probability of success.</p>

<p>Just at this decisive moment, the faint rays of the setting sun shone
forth, and as they struggled to penetrate the almost universal haze
created by the hitherto unremitting volumes of smoke which a close
dense atmosphere appeared incapable of altogether dissipating, they
cast upon the varied and multitudinous objects on the Field, a lurid
light, imparting to them a colouring so strikingly impressive, as
can never be effaced from the memories of those who witnessed that
magnificent Battle scene.</p>

<p>In front of the Line, on the rise occupied by <span class="smcap">Maitland</span>'s
Brigade of Guards, stood prominently in view, the great and noble Duke
himself, his hat raised high in air, as the signal for the commencement
of the General Advance; leaders in front of their Divisions and
Brigades, appearing, by their animated gestures, to take their tone
from their great Chieftain; unfurled Colours raised aloft, proudly
displaying their shattered remnants; drums, bugles, trumpets, sending
forth their warlike sounds to commingle with the enthusiastic and
tumultuous cheering of the troops; Artillerymen occupied in working
out their guns from the soft soil in which they had become so deeply
imbedded; Squadrons and Supports pressing forward to gain the ridge,
as this became vacated by the First Line, to behold, and participate
in, the glorious triumph; numerous isolated Soldiers, hurrying on,
wherever they could be spared from attending the wounded, to join their
ranks, and share in the inspiring excitement of such a moment; in the
distance, in front, the retiring masses of the French, intermingled
with crowds of fugitives of all Arms, mounted and dismounted; far
away to the left, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span> dark Columns of the Prussians, and the smoke
ascending from their Batteries; on the right, and somewhat in advance,
the dense vapour still slowly circling upwards from the glowing embers
of Hougomont, assuming a reddish glare as it floated over the heads of
the brave defenders of that Post of Honour;&mdash;all appeared to the eyes
of the beholder illumined, as it were, by a light partaking rather of
the supernatural, than of the ordinary effects of sunshine. It was of
brief duration. The sun sank rapidly below the horizon, and if the
gorgeous colouring which departed with it had been congenial to the
exhilarated feelings of the victors; so, in an equal degree, must the
succeeding twilight, rendered still more gloomy by a clouded sky, have
toned in with the dejected and gloomy spirits of the vanquished. With
these there prevailed no other sentiments than those of a vexed and
mortified perplexity, or an extreme dismay. The panic which had set
in was extending itself wildly and speedily throughout the Line, and
despondency was depicted in every countenance.</p>

<p>The Duke galloped off to <span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s Brigade, which was then in
the valley immediately below the Height on which the three Squares of
the French Guard were posted; and as these appeared inclined to make a
stand, he ordered <span class="smcap">Adam</span> to attack them. The latter, however,
suggested to his Grace that as the Brigade, in consequence of its rapid
advance over the heavy soil in the valley, encumbered as the latter
was with dead and dying men and horses, both singly and in heaps,
had become somewhat loose in its formation, it might be advisable to
halt it, to allow the Files to close in. This was accordingly done.
But after a few moments only had elapsed, the Duke said, "They won't
stand&mdash;better attack them;" and being at the time close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span> to the
Colours of the centre Regiment (the 52nd), he called out, "Go on,
<span class="smcap">Colborne</span>, go on!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Colonel Sir <span class="smcap">Colin Campbell</span> now rejoined the Duke, and
explained the grounds upon which <span class="smcap">Vivian</span> had decided upon
attacking the French Cavalry Reserves: on learning which Lord
<span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span>, who was present, determined upon personally
leading the attack with the Hussars, and participating in the final
and decisive triumph of the British Cavalry; and was on the point
of darting off to that part of the Field, when his intentions were
suddenly frustrated by a grape shot from a Battery on the Height above
him striking and severely wounding his right leg.</p>

<p>Reluctantly compelled to desist from further exertion, this gallant and
noble warrior, who had so bravely, so chivalrously, so skilfully, and
so successfully, led the British Cavalry throughout the day, had still
the satisfaction of feeling and knowing that although not permitted
to witness the closing triumph of that branch of the Service of which
he was at once the Chief, the ornament, and pride, he had well and
truly performed his duty to his Sovereign and his country. He was
supported for some moments by Sir <span class="smcap">Colin Campbell</span>, and shortly
afterwards, with the assistance of a party of the 23rd Light Dragoons,
carried into the high road, along which he was borne to Waterloo; and,
when subsequently undergoing, at that Village, the necessary operation
of amputation, so great were the satisfaction and contentment which
had been wrought in his mind as he calmly reflected on the brilliant
exploits that had marked the arduous and varied struggle, that
observing the anxious and compassionate looks of his friends around his
couch, he exclaimed, "Who would not lose a leg for such a victory?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span></p>

<p>Seldom indeed has a Cavalry Chief more distinguished himself in the
Field than did the Earl of <span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span> on this great day.
As he flew from one point to another, now boldly rushing into the
fight at the head of a glorious charge, then skilfully covering a
retreat under the pressure of overpowering numbers; here zealously
endeavouring by his own personal example to stimulate and rouse into
action the lukewarm energies of an Ally; there collecting and rallying,
for further high emprize, the remnants of the devoted bands of his
own nation; restlessly vigilant in watching and preparing for the
man&oelig;uvres of a renowned and powerful Cavalry, admirably appointed
and equipped, and led by a <span class="smcap">Kellermann</span>, a <span class="smcap">Guyot</span>, and
a <span class="smcap">Lefèbvre Desnouettes</span>; evincing the most cool and resolute
confidence in the prowess of his followers, as he dashed forward
either to break asunder the combined advance of the Enemy's masses, or
to follow up the advantage already gained by the Allied Infantry&mdash;he
seemed to blend and embody in his own character, in a pre-eminent
degree, the heroic valour of ancient chivalry with the skilled address
of modern Cavalry tacticians.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As <span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s Brigade ascended the hill, in compliance with
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Orders, to charge the French Squares, it was
received with a heavy fire from their Front and Flanks. The Duke being
at this time close to the centre of the advancing Line, against which
point this fire was principally directed, incurred great personal
risk; and as the shot flew fast and thick about him, Sir <span class="smcap">Colin
Campbell</span> said to him, "This is no place for you&mdash;you had better
move."</p>

<p>To this the Duke replied, "I will when I see those fellows off." On the
near and imposing approach of the Brigade, in the attitude of charging,
the Imperial Guard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span> ceased firing, faced to the rear, and commenced a
retreat by word of command.</p>

<p>As they withdrew, his Grace rode up the valley in the direction of his
right front, and came upon the plain, on which <span class="smcap">Vivian</span> was
successfully attacking the French Reserves.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The gallant charge made by the 10th Hussars upon the French Cavalry
posted in its right front, has already been described.</p>

<p>After ordering the halt and rally, <span class="smcap">Vivian</span> galloped towards
the 18th Hussars, which Regiment he found well formed in Line, and in
perfect order. In its front stood the two Squares of the Grenadiers of
the Old Guard: in its left front, and much nearer to it, were posted
Artillery and Cavalry, in advance of the proper Right of the Squares.
This Cavalry consisted principally of <i>Cuirassiers</i>&mdash;the wrecks of
entire Brigades. Nearer to, and partly in rear of, the Squares, stood
the <i>Chasseurs</i> and <i>Grenadiers à Cheval</i> of the Imperial Guard,
greatly reduced in numbers.</p>

<p>It was immediately evident to <span class="smcap">Vivian</span> that the attack must
in the first instance be directed against the Advanced Cavalry and
Artillery; and having put the Line in motion, he placed himself in
front of the Centre, beside Lieutenant Colonel the Hon. <span class="smcap">Henry
Murray</span>, the Commanding Officer, for the purpose of putting the
Regiment into the required direction. This having been effected,
he ordered the charge; when the Hussars dashed forward with the
greatest impetuosity, and, at the same time, with as much steadiness
and regularity as if they had been at Field Day exercise on Hounslow
Heath. Thus, the direction of the charge by the 18th diverged as much
to the left, as that by the 10th had inclined to the right. Just as
the charge commenced, some French Artillery coming from their right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>
and slanting towards the right of the 18th, made a bold push to cross
the front of the latter at a gallop. But the attempt failed, and the
Hussars were instantly among them, cutting down the Artillerymen and
Drivers, and securing the guns. In the next moment they fell upon the
Advanced Cavalry, which they completely dispersed; and then, bringing
forward their left shoulders, they attacked the Cavalry and guns that
stood more to the right front, and near to the Right Square, which was
now retiring. This Cavalry appeared, at first, determined upon making
a stand; and an Officer in its front dashed forward, and fired at
Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Murray</span>; but, in another moment, the 18th
were fiercely and dexterously plying their swords amongst them. They
were forced to give way, the Artillerymen were driven from their guns,
and the whole fled in disorder.</p>

<p>The charge then ceased to be compact, for the assailants and the flying
were intermingled pell mell; all riding as fast as the confusion of
the <i>mêlée</i> would permit; a part of them along the high road, but
the principal portion on the Allied right of the latter; the whole,
however, passing by La Belle Alliance, and leaving the two Squares of
the Guard on their right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vivian</span>, satisfied with the complete success of the charge,
ordered the Regiment to halt and reform; whilst he proceeded himself
to bring up the 1st Hussars of the Legion, which Corps he had left in
reserve.</p>

<p>On his way he found Major the Hon. <span class="smcap">Frederick Howard</span>, with the
Right Squadron of the 10th Hussars, which, as before stated (see page
552), had been driven to the left by a charge of <i>Cuirassiers</i>. This
Squadron stood forward within a short distance of the Left Square of
the Grenadiers of the Guard, from the fire of which it was losing men
fast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vivian</span> doubted for a moment how far it might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span> advisable to
attack the Square; but perceiving an Infantry Regiment in red advancing
on his left, and calculating on its immediately charging the face and
angle of the Square next to it, he ordered Major <span class="smcap">Howard</span> to
charge the face and angle to which he was opposed. This was executed
with the greatest gallantry and determination. <span class="smcap">Vivian</span> himself
joined in the charge, on the right of the Squadron. The Hussars charged
home to the bayonets of the French Guard, and a fierce conflict ensued.
Major <span class="smcap">Howard</span> was killed at the head of his men. He was shot in
the mouth, and fell senseless to the ground; when one of the Imperial
Guard stepped out of the ranks, and brutally beat his head with the
butt end of his musket. Two other Officers, Lieutenants <span class="smcap">Arnold</span>
and <span class="smcap">Bacon</span>, were wounded. Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Gunning</span> was
killed immediately previous to the attack. The Regiment of Infantry,
however, did not charge, as <span class="smcap">Vivian</span> had expected; but continued
pursuing a separate Column in its own immediate front on the high road.</p>

<p>Although the Square, a very strong one, cannot be said to have been
broken by the shock, for the veteran Soldiers of whom it was composed
knew too well their power of resistance against such a handful of
horsemen; still the manner in which the latter, notwithstanding the
rapid diminution of their number, continued cutting at the ranks,
parrying bayonet thrusts, and pertinaciously pressing on, reflects
the highest credit on the 10th British Hussars. The men fought with
desperation; maddened probably by the fall of their Officers.</p>

<p>The Square, yielding to the pressure, continued to fall back until it
reached the hollow way formed by the narrow road that leads from the
<i>chaussée</i> in rear of La Belle Alliance, towards the Left of the French
position. Into this the Guard hastily descended in confusion, and
escaping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span> by either outlet, mingled with the host of fugitives hurrying
along the general line of retreat of the French Army.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the remainder of the 10th Hussars, consisting of
the Left and Centre Squadrons, that had, in the course of the first
charge, crossed over to the right of the rise of ground on which the
French Reserve Cavalry had been posted, had continued its course, under
Lord <span class="smcap">Robert Manners</span>, down into the valley, south-east of the
Hougomont inclosures. The routed Cavalry spread out in the utmost
confusion&mdash;<i>Cuirassiers</i>, of an almost gigantic size, galloped as hard
as they could; and numbers tumbled off their horses to save themselves.
The Hussars now came upon retiring Infantry that appeared seized with
a panic as their routed Cavalry dashed past them&mdash;the large bearskin
caps, worn by several of them, betokened a portion of the Imperial
Guard&mdash;they commenced throwing down their arms, numbers of them loudly
calling out "<i>Pardon!</i>"</p>

<p>Then crossing the same narrow road, before mentioned as leading from La
Belle Alliance to the Left of the French position (but on the Allied
right of the hollow way by which the Square of the Guard effected its
escape), the Hussars brought up their right shoulders, and ascended the
Height in rear of the hollow road. Upon the slope of the Hill, about
half a Battalion of the French Guard had rallied and formed, with some
Cavalry close behind them, and opened a sharp fire upon the 10th. Part
of the 18th Hussars, at this time, reached the hollow way, an obstacle,
however, which rendered <i>their</i> attack wholly impracticable. Lord
<span class="smcap">Robert Manners</span> halted for a minute, when within about forty
paces from them, to allow his men to form up. He then gave a cheer and
charged; when the Imperial Guard and the Cavalry instantly turned and
fled: the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span> greater portion of the former throwing themselves down, and
many of the latter tumbling off their horses.</p>

<p>The Hussars pursued up to the brow of the hill: on the further, or
south, side of which was a deep hollow; and beyond this a Knoll (on
the Allied right of the Charleroi road and nearly opposite <span class="smcap">de
Coster</span>'s house) upon which another Square of Infantry had formed,
and appeared very steady.</p>

<p>At this time a party of the 18th Hussars&mdash;not more than from thirty to
thirty five men&mdash;continuing the charge, before described, close along
the right of La Belle Alliance and Trimotion, and crossing the narrow
road near its junction with the Charleroi road, dashed down the hollow,
and ascending the Height above mentioned, charged the Square in most
gallant style; but, as might have been expected, was checked and turned
by the latter.</p>

<p>Lord <span class="smcap">Robert Manners</span> and Captain <span class="smcap">Taylor</span> had rallied
a party of the 10th Hussars, with a view to support the 18th, should
these be charged in their turn; which however did not occur.</p>

<p>The two last mentioned Regiments had, by this time, been thrown so
much into disorder by their charges, that it became necessary to
check their further advance, in order to gain time for collecting and
reforming their ranks. Although this measure was supported by the
coming up of the 1st Hussars of the Legion to take post in front of the
Brigade, and was also rendered secure by the advance, on the right, of
<span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span>'s Brigade (which had come up on <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s
right, and between him and the inclosures of Hougomont, in Column of
Squadrons, at the moment he was preparing to charge the Square of
the Imperial Guard with the party of the 10th Hussars under Major
<span class="smcap">Howard</span>); still the rallying and reforming of those two
Regiments was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span> attended with considerable difficulty, inasmuch as they
had become completely intermingled with the fugitives.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is now necessary to recur to <span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s Brigade, which we left
advancing, and driving before it, near the Charleroi road, the three
Squares of the Guard that had retired as it approached to charge them.
It will be recollected that, upon the Brigade first advancing from
the Allied position, Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Halkett</span> followed it
in immediate rear of its Right Flank, with the Osnabrück Battalion
of Hanoverian Landwehr. When <span class="smcap">Adam</span> reached the three Squares
above mentioned, <span class="smcap">Halkett</span>, having the shortest space of ground
to move over, soon came up in Line with the Brigade, still pursuing
the Column formed by the two Battalions of <i>Chasseurs</i> of the Old
Guard. The Osnabrückers having then become much annoyed by a fire that
opened upon them obliquely from a French Battery within a very short
distance of their right, their 1st Company broke into subdivisions
and, supported by the Sharpshooters of the Battalion, made a dash
at the Artillery, and captured six guns. During the greater part of
the advance, they had been in almost close contact with the Column
formed by the two Battalions of <i>Chasseurs</i> of the Old Guard; and
<span class="smcap">Halkett</span> frequently called out to them to surrender.</p>

<p>Having for some short time fixed his eye upon an individual whom he
took to be the General Officer in command of the Guard, from his being
in full uniform, and from the animation he displayed in his endeavours
to induce his men to stand their ground; and observing that the Column,
after receiving the fire of the Osnabrückers, left the General with
two Officers in its rear, he ordered the Sharpshooters to dash on,
whilst he, at the same time darted forward at full gallop to attack the
General. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span> he had come up with him, and was about to cut him down;
the latter called out that he would surrender.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cambronne</span>, for he it was, then preceded <span class="smcap">Halkett</span> as
he returned to the Hanoverian Battalion; but had not gone many paces
before <span class="smcap">Halkett</span>'s horse was wounded, and fell to the ground.
In a few seconds, however, <span class="smcap">Halkett</span> succeeded in getting him
on his legs again, when he found that his prisoner was escaping in the
direction of the French Column: he instantly overtook him, seized him
by the <i>aiguilette</i>, brought him to the Battalion, and gave him in
charge to a Serjeant of the Osnabrückers who was to deliver him to the
Duke.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s Brigade had by this time crossed to the opposite side
of the Charleroi road, and, bringing forward its left shoulders,
was continuing its advance, in pursuit of the defeated Squares, in
a direction parallel with that road; whilst <span class="smcap">Halkett</span>, by
continuing on the inner flank, and following the Battalions of the
<i>Chasseurs</i> of the Old Guard, had got somewhat in advance, or rather,
in right front of that Brigade; and had, shortly before, reached the
immediate vicinity of that part of the Field on which <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>
was in the act of preparing to charge the Square of the Grenadiers
of the Old Guard with the Squadron of the 10th Hussars under Major
<span class="smcap">Howard</span>. The Osnabrückers will here be recognised as the
Regiment of Allied Infantry already alluded to in the description given
of that Charge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adam</span>, after his repulse of the three Squares of the Imperial
Guard, perceiving that he was so much in front of the main Line of the
Anglo-Allied Army, and not being aware of <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s advance,
had become apprehensive of an attack upon his Right Flank; and he
therefore desired his Brigade Major, Major <span class="smcap">Blair</span>, to proceed
in the prolongation of his Right Flank, and observe whether there was
any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span> threatening appearance of the Enemy's Cavalry in that quarter.
The latter, pursuing his errand, met the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>
moving at a quick pace, followed by a single individual, to whom Major
<span class="smcap">Blair</span> addressed himself, but who immediately checked him by
remarking, "<i>Monsieur, je ne parle pas un seul mot d'Anglais!</i>" Major
<span class="smcap">Blair</span> then explained to him, in French, the Order he had
received, to which he replied, "<i>Le Duc lui même a été voir; il n'y a
rien à craindre</i>;" whereupon the former returned to <span class="smcap">Adam</span>, with
this satisfactory information.</p>

<p>Here, then, was the great Chieftain himself, still in the Battle's
front, vigilantly watching, and eagerly seizing advantage of, the
course of events; braving every peril, and acting solely upon his own
personal observation; his Staff, and even Orderlies, almost all killed
or wounded; the very few that remained untouched, carrying messages;
his only attendant, a foreigner (Major Count <span class="smcap">de Sales</span>, a
Sardinian Officer), attached to his suite!</p>

<p>It is impossible not to recognise in the extraordinary degree of
security with which this great man so fearlessly exposed himself
throughout the entire day, the protecting interposition of an all wise
and merciful Providence. At this moment, too, he was not only upon
the track of his great antagonist; but, in all probability, within
the shortest distance that ever separated these wonderful men from
each other: the one, alone, and in front of his advancing Line, borne
forward on the wings of victory, and upheld by the knowledge of his
might and the fulness of his glory; the other, seeking shelter amidst
his devoted, yet broken and dispirited, cohorts; abandoning himself to
despair, and flying from the fatal Field on which the sceptre he had
usurped was signally and irrecoverably struck from his iron grasp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span></p>




<p class="ph2"><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></p>


<p class="drop">THE very forward movement of <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s Brigade, and the
vigorous attack which it made against the Centre of the French
position, having rendered obvious the necessity of an immediate
Support, <span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span>'s Brigade was despatched across the ridge
in Column of Half Squadrons, Right in front, at the moment of the
General Advance of the Line.</p>

<p>It proceeded at a smart trot along the east side of the Hougomont
inclosures, and then descended into the valley in rear of the latter,
passing <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s Brigade on its left. Here it fell in with
disordered Columns of the French Infantry in full retreat; as also
Cavalry, of all kinds mixed together, the <i>Cuirassiers</i> throwing
off their armour to facilitate their flight. In the midst of this
confusion, however, there stood higher up the valley a large Column on
the opposite side of the road which connects the Centre with the Left
of the French position, forming Square, and seemingly determined to
oppose the further advance of the Brigade. The latter, receiving the
fire from the Column, charged; and the French giving way, the whole of
them were taken or destroyed. In this charge the 11th Light Dragoons,
forming the Right of the Brigade, captured a Battery on the Height to
which the before mentioned road ascends. It was the last which had
maintained the cannonade from the French Left Wing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span>'s Brigade continued to press forward, driving a host
of fugitives before it. It was by this time in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span> advance, and rather in
Right Front, of <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>. Colonel Sir <span class="smcap">Felton Harvey</span>,
of the Staff, came up to its then Commander, Lieutenant Colonel
<span class="smcap">Sleigh</span>, of the 11th Light Dragoons,&mdash;<span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span>
having taken the command of the Cavalry upon the fall of Lord
<span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span>,&mdash;and informed him that a French Cavalry Brigade was
moving along the Heights on the right (or western) side of the Valley.
The Cavalry did not, however, venture to descend into the lower ground,
where it might have fallen upon <span class="smcap">Sleigh</span>'s Right Flank; but
continued its course along the high ground towards some point on the
Charleroi road, quite in rear of the main French Army, apparently with
the intention of protecting the retreat and rallying the fugitives.
It was <span class="smcap">Piré</span>'s Light Cavalry Brigade, that had been stationed
throughout the day on the extreme Left of the French Line.</p>

<p>In this manner, <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s Brigade, which had not only broken,
but completely pierced, the Centre of the French position, had its
Right effectually protected; and due advantage was promptly taken of
the disorder into which its bold and successful advance had thrown
those French troops that had been moving in that quarter. At the
same time, <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s Left was secured by the advance of
<span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s Brigade, which continued to drive before it, along the
left side of the Charleroi road, the Squares of the Guard, as also the
<i>Cuirassiers</i> by whom the latter were supported. These <i>Cuirassiers</i>,
it should be observed, had fronted and evinced a disposition to charge
as the Brigade crossed the high road. <span class="smcap">Adam</span>, however, feeling
secure in his four deep formation, continued pressing towards them;
and when, along that part of his Line against which the attack was
threatened, the British bayonets were lowered, the <i>Cuirassiers</i>
declined the contest.</p>

<p>Having thus detailed the brilliant successes of these three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span> British
Brigades, with which <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> had so boldly assailed the
Centre, and effectually destroyed the last Reserves, of the Enemy; it
is now time to consider their important consequences in conjunction
with the General Advance of the Anglo-Allied Army; and for this purpose
it will be necessary to take a more extended view of the prominent
features which the Field of Battle presented at this period of the day.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On no part of the French Army, beyond the immediate sphere of action
of the above Brigades, did the advance of the latter exercise so
powerful an influence as on <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s Corps, which constituted
its Right Wing. The defeat of the Second attacking Column of the
Imperial Guard, it will be recollected, involved in it the retreat
of <span class="smcap">Donzelot</span>'s Division of that Corps; which, from the cover
afforded it by the possession of La Haye Sainte, and from the hollow
on its left of that Farm, had so furiously assailed the central
portion of the Duke's Line, occupied by <span class="smcap">Alten</span>'s Division.
On the opposite side of the Charleroi road, from the Knoll above the
Sand Pit, part of <span class="smcap">Alix</span>'s Division was still maintaining a
most destructive fire upon the remains of <span class="smcap">Picton</span>'s Division
and of <span class="smcap">Lambert</span>'s Brigade posted along the Wavre road. The
remainder of this Division, as well as that under <span class="smcap">Marcognet</span>,
were advancing across the valley which separated the Anglo-Allied
Left, from the French Right, Wing; and presented an array of Columns
between the Knoll on the left of La Haye Sainte and the Left of
<span class="smcap">Durutte</span>'s Division: which latter was now operating in concert
with <span class="smcap">Lobau</span>'s Corps in maintaining a defensive position against
the advance of the Prussians.</p>

<p>When, therefore, <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> so suddenly launched forth
<span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s Hussar Brigade against <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s Reserves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span>
then posted close to La Belle Alliance in the very Centre of the
French Army; and also pushed forward <span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s Light Infantry
Brigade past the Farm and Orchard of La Haye Sainte towards the
eminence on which stood the three rallied Squares of the Imperial
Guard; he completely turned the Left of <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s Corps: and
by means of the brilliant success which attended these movements, he
gradually established himself in rear both of <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span> and of
<span class="smcap">Lobau</span>; the latter of whom was still defending himself against
<span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s advance.</p>

<p>In like manner, the Columns of <span class="smcap">Reille</span>'s Corps, comprising the
Left Wing of the French Army, and which were advancing through, and
contiguously to, the Hougomont inclosures, were turned in their Right
Flank.</p>

<p>Thus, by this bold and masterly man&oelig;uvre, the whole Front Line of
the French Army, which, a short time before, had presented so menacing
an appearance, was thrown into disorder and confusion: and supported
as that man&oelig;uvre was by the advance, at the right moment, of the
Duke's entire Line; any attempt, on the part of the French, to rally
and resume the offensive, was entirely frustrated. The firm, decided,
and determined attitude which <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> had assumed, had, in
fact, struck terror and dismay into the ranks of his opponent: who,
perceiving the hasty and confused retreat of his troops, as also the
extreme pressure upon his Right by the formidable and now more general
attack on the part of <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, became completely paralyzed;
and conscious of the utter futility of attempting to stem the torrent,
he threw himself for temporary shelter into the Square of the 2nd
Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of <i>Chasseurs</i> of the Guard.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Allied Line continued its magnificent Advance; which was in
truth a march of triumph, not of attack, since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span> all fled before its
approach. In the Centre, <span class="smcap">Lambert</span>'s Brigade, together with the
1st or Royal Scots, crossed to the Charleroi road, and took possession
of La Haye Sainte; which was found entirely abandoned to the wounded
and the dying, who constituted its sole but numerous occupants. The
troops that had stood in rear of Hougomont, now poured into its
inclosures, aiding and supporting those who had so bravely maintained
that important Post in completely clearing it of its assailants;
as many of the latter in the Wood, ignorant of what was passing in
the open Field, still endeavoured to hold their ground. The Light
Troops on the right of Hougomont crossed the Nivelles road without
opposition: not only the Infantry in their front having retired, but
<span class="smcap">Piré</span>'s Light Cavalry Brigade, which had formed the extreme
Left of the French Army during the whole day, having been ordered to
proceed to the rear of the Centre to cover the general retreat.</p>

<p>The extreme Left of the Line was flanked by the Prussian Regiments of
Cavalry, belonging to <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Corps, previously mentioned as
having joined shortly before the General Advance; and the Battalions of
the First Prussian Infantry Brigade, together with the Nassau Brigade
under Prince <span class="smcap">Bernhard</span> of Saxe Weimar, were pressing up the
Heights against the Left of <span class="smcap">Durutte</span>'s Division posted at the
apex of the angle of <i>potence</i> on which stood the extreme Right of
the French Army. As the Allied Left descended the outer slope of the
position, those Columns of <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s Corps which had advanced
to attack it, were hastily retiring; part of them, indeed, along and
near the Charleroi road, had already fallen back in disorder the moment
they became aware of the defeat of the troops on the other side of
that road, and of the advance of <span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s Brigade, by which
their Left Flank was completely turned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span> and their rear most seriously
endangered. <span class="smcap">Durutte</span>'s Division, forming, as before observed,
the Right of <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s Corps, and posted in the angle of
<i>potence</i>, perceiving in its direct rear, the retreat of the Imperial
Guard, followed by British Infantry; as also that of the Columns of its
own Corps on its Left, followed by the Anglo-Allied Line; besides the
attack of the Prussians in its Front and on its Right, and which was
increasing every moment in vigour and effect; at once saw the certainty
of its being cut off if it remained in its present attitude: and hence,
aware of its own helplessness, it took to flight.</p>

<p>In the next moment the renewed cheering along the Anglo-Allied Left
Wing, announced that it had reached and captured the strong Line of
Batteries; by the fire of which, maintained during the entire day, its
ranks had been so awfully diminished. <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Battalions took
possession, also, of the Batteries which had protected the apex of the
angle of <i>potence</i>, and which had been covered by <span class="smcap">Durutte</span>'s
Division. Notwithstanding the confused retreat of the Flank Columns of
<span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s Corps, those which constituted the central portion
of his Line had hitherto retired in some little degree of order: but
now they began rapidly to dissolve as the Allied Line approached;
and, soon spreading out, they broke forth into one general crowd of
fugitives.</p>

<p>The flight of these troops immediately along the rear of
<span class="smcap">Lobau</span>'s Line, at the very moment of its being most vigorously
assailed by the Thirteenth and Fifteenth Infantry Brigades of
<span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Corps, covered by an overpowering cannonade, involved
its ranks in the general panic which had become uncontrollable. The
whole Corps rushed wildly into the stream of fugitives which, with
overwhelming force, had set in towards Rossomme and Maison du Roi, on
the Charleroi road, the direct line of retreat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time (about a quarter past eight o'clock), <span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s
Brigade, pursuing its course on the left side of the high road, was
ascending the higher ground in rear of La Belle Alliance. Here it fell
into the line of fire of one of <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Batteries; which had
immediately followed up the retreat of <span class="smcap">Lobau</span>'s Corps, and
opened a cannonade from the previous position of the latter, at a
distance of about seven hundred yards. <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, perceiving
that this fire might occasion serious injury to his advancing troops,
directed Count <span class="smcap">de Sales</span> (who was still his sole attendant)
to proceed to the Prussian Battery, and cause it to cease firing; its
Commanding Officer not being aware that its shot were falling among
British troops. <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>, on becoming acquainted with this
circumstance, immediately checked the fire of his Artillery; and, at
the same time, ordered the Infantry of his Right to refrain from firing
during its forward movement.</p>

<p>The road which leads from the <i>chaussée</i> across the Height in rear of
La Belle Alliance, towards Planchenoit, becomes, after a distance of
about a hundred yards, a complete hollow way. As it was approached by
<span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s Brigade, a Column of Artillery and Infantry, from the
French Right, was hastily retreating up that part of it which was in
front of the 52nd Regiment, quite unaware of its having fallen into
the immediate vicinity of British Infantry. Astonished by the sudden
appearance of the latter along the bank, the Column hesitated for a
moment what course to adopt. The Infantry at first presented some
little show of defence; but soon threw down their arms, dispersed and
escaped as best they could. The Artillery made a dash at the opposite
bank, but some of the horses of each gun were instantly brought down by
a fire from the British, and the attempt failed. The Commanding Officer
of the Battery, as if in a fit of desperation, standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</a></span> in the centre
of his guns, waved his sword above his head in defiance. A soldier from
the 52nd Regiment sprang forward, parried his thrust, closed with him,
threw him on the ground, and bayoneted him. The guns were immediately
abandoned.</p>

<p>On the Right of the Brigade, the 71st Regiment having gained the Height
on which a Reserve Battery of the Imperial Guard had been posted the
entire day, and had just made an attempt to draw off into the high
road, it was captured by that Corps; when some men of the Right Flank
Company of the latter (Captain <span class="smcap">Reed</span>'s), under Lieutenant
<span class="smcap">Torriano</span>, immediately turned round one of the guns, which was
then discharged into the retiring Columns of the Imperial Guard by
Captain <span class="smcap">Campbell</span>, Aide de Camp to Major General <span class="smcap">Adam</span>,
and was, there is reason to believe, the last French gun fired on that
day.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Halkett</span>, who, with the Hanoverian Battalion
Osnabrück, had entered the Charleroi road, near La Belle Alliance,
continued to press before him the two Battalions of the <i>Chasseurs</i>
of the Old Guard, under the protection of which, <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>
with several of his principal Staff Officers were retiring from the
Field. <span class="smcap">Halkett</span> soon found himself in the midst of a great but
disordered mass of the Enemy's Cavalry, which menaced the Battalion
in a most vociferous manner; but, after receiving the fire from the
latter, it went off in all directions. Further on, perceiving several
guns in full retreat, he sent the Sharpshooters of the Battalion,
supported by a Company, amongst them; who, by their fire, increased
the confusion, and then made many prisoners, and cut the traces of the
horses from the leading guns.</p>

<p>The Regiments of Prussian Cavalry belonging to <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Corps,
before mentioned as having joined the Left of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span> Anglo-Allied Army,
after crossing the valley and ascending the French position, had got
somewhat in advance of the Left of the Anglo-Allied Infantry, taking
the direction of Rossomme; but they soon found their progress most
seriously obstructed and retarded by the vast crowds of fugitives of
all Arms intermingled in the wildest confusion.</p>

<p>Such was also the case with the much more advanced British Light
Cavalry Brigades under <span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span> and <span class="smcap">Vivian</span> on the
right of the Charleroi road. In fact, the Cavalry thus situated in the
Van of the Duke's victorious Army, had now become almost helpless: it
seemed as if carried aloft on the billows of the agitated sea, yielding
rather to its impulses than controlling the angry element.</p>

<p>As might have been expected, there were innumerable instances in which
the rage and disappointment of the conquered foe gave rise to covert
assaults, which, however, were speedily repressed; more especially by
the Prussians, against whom a word or look sufficed to draw down their
vengeance upon an Enemy whom they held in detestation. The 10th and
18th British Hussars of <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s Brigade, whilst endeavouring
to reform between La Belle Alliance and Rossomme, found themselves in
the midst of an immense crowd, composed partly of defeated soldiers of
the Imperial Guard; who could but ill conceal their mortification, and
who seized every opportunity that afforded to gratify their hatred and
revenge. Lieutenant Colonel the Hon. <span class="smcap">Henry Murray</span>, commanding
the 18th, was very nearly bayoneted by one of them; and his Orderly was
compelled, for the security of his master, to cut down five or six in
rapid succession.</p>

<p>A remarkable exception to the general disorganisation of the French
Army was manifested about this time in front of <span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span>'s
Brigade, which was the furthest in advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span> of any of the Allied
troops. In the midst of the crowd of fugitives which impeded the
progress of the Brigade; there appeared a Regiment of Cavalry, moving
at a walk, in Close Column, and in perfect order, as if disdaining
to allow itself to be contaminated by the confusion that prevailed
around it. It was the <i>Grenadiers à Cheval</i>. The 12th British Light
Dragoons were the nearest to it, having got in advance of the rest of
the Brigade, and were opposite the Right Flank of the Column, whence a
few pistol or carbine shots were fired at them. The 12th made a partial
attack; but they were so much inferior in numbers (being very weak at
this period), and were so greatly obstructed in their movements by the
crowd, that they were unable to produce any impression upon so compact
and steady a body of Cavalry; which literally walked from the Field
in the most orderly manner, moving majestically along the stream, the
surface of which was covered with the innumerable wrecks into which the
rest of the French Army had been scattered.</p>

<p>As <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> and his Staff were at this time retiring along
the high road, on the Right Flank of this Cavalry of the Guard; it is
reasonable to infer that the latter was therefore induced to maintain
the admirable order in which it was thus seen, to secure the Emperor's
retreat.</p>

<p>Whilst the great mass of the French Army, in a state of thorough
disorganisation, was thus driven by <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s victorious
troops across the whole extent of ground which had constituted its
general position; as also, on its Right, by that portion of the
Prussian troops consisting of part of <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s, and of the
Right Wing of <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s, Corps: the Battalions of the French
Imperial Guard in Planchenoit were maintaining a most desperate and
obstinate contest with <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Left Wing, aided by a part of
<span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s Corps, to which the attack of the Village had been
confided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span></p>

<p>The principal force of the Imperial Guard having taken post within the
central portion of the Village, and strongly occupied the Churchyard;
the headmost Columns of this Third Prussian attack met with a most
destructive fire as they pressed forward through the lanes that led
towards the eastern side of the Church. The supporting Columns now
came up, and joined in the <i>fusillade</i> that was maintained with the
French in the Churchyard; the stone wall encircling which, lined with
troops, gave to it the appearance of a little fortress. The Prussians,
extending their front so as to envelope a considerable portion of
the Churchyard, and taking advantage of the houses and inclosures
which they had reached on their own side, maintained a terrific
fire upon their opponents; and as the latter appeared resolved to
keep them at bay to the last, a great loss of life occurred on both
sides. The soldiers of the Imperial Guard fought desperately; and so
greatly was their animosity excited, that some Officers of the 15th
Prussian Regiment and of the Silesian Landwehr, who had been made
prisoners in the previous attack, were with difficulty saved by General
<span class="smcap">Pelet</span>'s personal exertions from becoming a sacrifice to their
fury. Reinforcements were moved into the Churchyard from the Reserves
on its western side; and the pertinacity with which the attacks upon it
were repelled showed very plainly that other means than that of a front
assault must be resorted to for forcing the French from a Post which
afforded them such superior advantages in the defence of the Village.</p>

<p>If the Prussians attempted to outflank the Churchyard by advancing
along the low open space on its right; they became exposed to the
commanding fire from its walls, to that from the opposite houses, and
in front, to the Reserves. If they ventured to pass close by its left
they had but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</a></span> narrow road open to them, bounded by the Churchyard
wall on one side strongly lined by the defenders, and by houses on
the other which the Enemy still occupied, and presenting also at its
further extremity a Farm House and its offices in flames, situated
so close to the Churchyard as to conceal by its smoke any Column of
Reserve that might be posted in that quarter.</p>

<p>Hence it was determined to act upon a broader extent of Front, and
to turn the entire Village on both Flanks; so as either to force, or
to intercept, the retreat of the Enemy from his stronghold in the
Churchyard. On the Prussian Left, Major <span class="smcap">Witzleben</span>, with the
Fusilier Battalion of the 25th Regiment, had already crossed the
rivulet which divides the Village into two nearly equal parts, and
was attacking that portion of the French Guard which was posted upon
the narrow ridge which lies between that rivulet and the Lasne. His
Skirmishers were joined upon their left by those that had preceded
the 1st and 2nd Battalions of this Regiment; and which latter having
pushed through the Wood of Virère, were now following close up in
support of the attack on this part of Planchenoit. These Skirmishers
were also connected on their left with those of the Fusilier Battalions
of both the 15th Regiment and the 1st Silesian Landwehr, under Major
<span class="smcap">Keller</span>, who was advancing along the right bank of the Lasne.
Along the crest of this ridge runs a narrow road, with several cottages
on either side of the latter: the ground is throughout intersected with
hedges and studded with trees; and altogether admirably adapted for a
protracted defence by Light Troops. Every house, every lane, and every
hedge was gallantly contested.</p>

<p>The Prussians not only boldly attacking in front; but skilfully
and gradually turning the ridge upon both sides, at length gained
possession of all this portion of the Village,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span> and thus outflanked
the troops in the Churchyard, who maintained to the last a most
desperate defence. In the mean time, the houses and inclosures on the
left of the Church had also been turned on that side by the Right of
the Prussian attack: and principally by the 5th Westphalian Landwehr,
the Skirmishers of which had beaten back their opponents close under
the walls of the burning buildings; the bright flames from which,
gleaming upon the combatants, who rent the air with their shouts, gave
a peculiar wildness to this scene of mortal strife. But still more wild
and awful must have been the scene within the Church, as the red flood
of light which they poured through the windows of the aisles, fell upon
the agonised and distorted features of the wounded and the dying with
which that sacred edifice was at this moment filled.</p>

<p>The Prussians continued pressing forward along both Flanks of the
Village, driving the Imperial Guard from house to house, from hedge
to hedge, and from tree to tree, until at length it became obvious to
the French that their rear would soon be intercepted. The latter were
also by this time fully aware of the <i>déroute</i> of the main Army; and,
giving up all for lost as they fell back upon the western portion of
the Village, they made a hasty and disorderly retreat towards Maison du
Roi.</p>

<p>The <i>Chasseurs</i> of the Old Guard were the last to quit the Churchyard,
and suffered severely as they retired. Their numbers were awfully
diminished; and <span class="smcap">Pelet</span>, collecting together about 250 of them,
found himself vigorously assailed by the Prussian Cavalry from the
moment he quitted the confines of Planchenoit and entered upon the
plain between the latter and the high road. At one time, his ranks
having opened out too much in the hurry of their retreat, some of the
Prussian troops in pursuit, both Cavalry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span> and Infantry, endeavoured to
capture the Eagle, which, covered with black crape, was carried in the
midst of this devoted little band of Veterans. <span class="smcap">Pelet</span>, taking
advantage of a spot of ground which afforded them some degree of cover
against the fire of grape by which they were constantly assailed,
halted the Standard Bearer, and called out "<i>A moi, Chasseurs! sauvons
l'Aigle ou mourons autour d'elle!</i>" The <i>Chasseurs</i> immediately pressed
around him, forming what is usually termed the Rallying Square; and,
lowering their bayonets, succeeded in repulsing the charge of Cavalry.
Some guns were then brought to bear upon them, and subsequently a brisk
fire of musketry: but notwithstanding the awful sacrifice which was
thus offered up in defence of their precious charge, they succeeded in
reaching the main line of retreat, favoured by the universal confusion,
as also by the general obscurity which now prevailed; and thus saved
alike the Eagle and the honour of the Regiment.</p>

<p>The Reserve Cavalry of the Second and Fourth Prussian Corps received
Orders to pass to the front through the Infantry: that of the Fourth
Corps, under Prince <span class="smcap">William</span> of Prussia, moved by the right of
Planchenoit, as also through the Village itself; but its progress was
greatly impeded by the fugitives that crowded towards Maison du Roi.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the Prussian Battalions that had been detached for
the protection of the Left of the attack upon Planchenoit, namely the
Fusilier Battalion of the 15th Regiment, and that of the 1st Silesian
Landwehr, under Major <span class="smcap">Keller</span>, as also that of the 25th
Regiment, under Major <span class="smcap">Witzleben</span>, had turned the Village, and
followed the Enemy nearly in the direction of Maison du Roi. They met
with some resistance on the part of the Battalion of the Grenadiers of
the Imperial Guard, which had advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span> from Caillon, in pursuance of
the Orders it had received, into the Wood of Chantelet; but they soon
forced their way to the high road, and by their presence added greatly
to the disorder in which the Enemy was flying from the Field.</p>

<p>Major <span class="smcap">Falkenhausen</span>, having remarked the retreat of the French,
as he stood on the Height of Seroulx, to which he had been detached
with one hundred Horsemen of the 3rd Silesian Landwehr Cavalry, also
moved down upon the high road, and charging the Flank of the flying
Foe, tended still further to augment the alarm and confusion that
prevailed.</p>

<p>When the French Imperial Guard was falling back from Planchenoit in
disorder and confusion towards the high road between Rossomme and
Maison du Roi, <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Advanced Brigades had reached the
former place. It was about half past eight o'clock&mdash;perhaps somewhat
later&mdash;and the darkness, which had been rapidly setting in, had become
so great as to render it difficult to distinguish one particular body
of troops from another.</p>

<p>Some little time before this, one of the Prussian Advanced Regiments of
Cavalry, suddenly entering the high road between La Belle Alliance and
Rossomme, came into partial collision with the 18th British Hussars;
who, not anticipating the presence of any other foreign troops in that
vicinity than those of the French Army, commenced an attack upon them:
cuts were exchanged, and some few lives lost, before the error was
corrected.</p>

<p>The 1st Hussars of the German Legion, while advancing along the right
of the high road, came upon the rear of <span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span>'s Brigade,
and were all but in collision with the 11th and 16th British Light
Dragoons; which Regiments, having previously ascertained that a
Brigade of French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</a></span> Cavalry (<span class="smcap">Piré</span>'s) was on their right, and
perceiving, though but dimly, in the dark, the approach of a strong
body of horsemen towards their rear, concluded that an attempt was made
to intercept their retreat. They immediately went "threes about," and
struck into a charge. On the other hand, the 1st German Hussars, not
being aware that any British Cavalry was in their front, and misled in
a great measure by the sudden clamour of French voices proceeding from
the numerous fugitives, who, taking the alarm, were endeavouring to get
out of their way, prepared to charge, and gave a loud cheer. This cheer
was fortunately recognised by the British Dragoons, when in the act of
charging, as that of the 1st German Hussars; and was thus the means
of preventing a rencontre that might have been productive of the most
fatal consequences to the parties concerned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wellington</span> had, previously to this, given Orders that the main
body of his Army should halt upon what had been the French position,
in the Line of La Belle Alliance; having arranged, by communication
with <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, that the latter, whose troops were comparatively
fresh, should take up the pursuit: and, as the Prussians continued
moving forward in great force towards the high road, he directed his
own troops to proceed to the right of the latter, so as to leave
it clear for their advance. The Prussian Regiments, on passing the
British, caused their bands to play the national anthem, <i>GOD save the
King!</i> a compliment which was greeted, on the part of the latter, by
hearty and friendly cheers.</p>

<p>The Duke now stood with his Advance of both Infantry and Cavalry, on
the elevated ground beyond Rossomme, overlooking Maison du Roi. The
moon had risen, and by the light it gradually spread over the Field, as
also by the objects set fire to at intervals along the high road,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span> the
retreating line of his vanquished Foe became sufficiently perceptible
to satisfy him that the brilliant victory he had gained was rendered
secure beyond a doubt. Having ordered his Advanced Brigades to take up
their bivouacs for the night, he returned from this distant part of the
Field, and proceeded leisurely along the Charleroi road back towards
Waterloo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adam</span>'s Brigade bivouacked on the spot it had reached;
<span class="smcap">Vandeleur</span>'s on the right, near the Wood of Callois in which
stood the Observatory; while <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>, inclining somewhat to
his right, led his Hussars much further in advance of the Army, on the
French side of the Observatory, and established his bivouac close to
the Hamlet of Hilaincourt.</p>

<p>On approaching La Belle Alliance, <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> ordered the whole
of his Army to bivouac on the Field of Battle. On reaching that point,
he met <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>; and mutual congratulations took place between
them on the splendid victory achieved. The latter, taking advantage of
the designation of the House as felicitously applicable to the meeting
of the two Commanders, and considering also that it had constituted
the direction point for the advance of the main portion of his troops,
styled this glorious contest the Battle of La Belle Alliance. With
the promise of vigorously following up the pursuit, and allowing the
Enemy no opportunity of rallying within a march from the Field, he took
his leave of the Duke; who then continued to ride leisurely towards
Waterloo, where he passed the night.</p>

<p>The circumstances of the Duke having established his Head Quarters
in this Village, and the name of the latter being more consonant to
English pronunciation than that of any other place nearer to the Field,
acquired for this ever memorable struggle, the designation, by the
British, of the <span class="smcap">Battle of Waterloo</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, determined to allow no breathing time to the flying
Enemy, and to deprive him of all power of rallying, at least on
this side of the French frontier, gave Orders that <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s
Corps should undertake the pursuit along the Charleroi road; that
<span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Corps should follow in support of <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>;
and that <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s Corps should march by Aywiers, and cross the
Dyle, for the purpose of intercepting <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s troops; which,
it was presumed, would soon be retreating from Wavre towards the Sambre.</p>

<p>The Prussian Battalions, already mentioned as having turned the
Village of Planchenoit, and entered the high road near Maison du Roi,
accompanied by only three Squadrons of Uhlans, formed the Advance of
the pursuing Army. <span class="smcap">Gneisenau</span>, placing himself at their head,
proceeded to carry into effect the commands of his veteran Chief and
friend. The Cavalry, under Prince <span class="smcap">William</span>, followed; and then
the Infantry of the two Corps.</p>

<p>At Genappe, the first important Defile through which the main French
Army retired, an immense number of carriages and waggons of all kinds
had been collected together&mdash;some having been withdrawn from the Field,
and others, such as those of the Commissariat or Ordnance Departments,
having come up to join, or to follow in the track of, the French Army.
By judicious management, these materials, combined with a suitable
defence, would have afforded the means of seriously impeding the
further pursuit by the victors. Some intention of this kind appeared
to have been entertained, as several waggons had been upset, so as to
obstruct the crossing of the Bridge, a narrow passage only being left
to admit stragglers. But no sooner did the Prussian Advance appear,
in the moonlight, descending from the Heights overlooking Genappe,
with drums beating and bugles sounding, than the rearmost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</a></span> of the
French troops (for Rear Guard there was none to an Army from which all
semblance of order and regularity had vanished), immediately after
firing a few shots, fled from the place. This was at about eleven
o'clock. The quantity of baggage that was collected here presented a
rich booty to the Prussians; but the most valuable and most interesting
object consisted of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s travelling carriage, which,
with all its contents, fell into the hands of the Fusilier Battalion of
the 15th Regiment.</p>

<p>The Infantry of <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s and <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Corps halted at
Genappe: but as soon as the Prussian Advance, including the Cavalry
under Prince <span class="smcap">William</span>, had succeeded in forcing its way through
the immense mass of waggons and carriages of all kinds with which this
Defile had been blocked up, <span class="smcap">Gneisenau</span>, moving the Infantry
along the road, and flanking it on each side by the Cavalry, continued
the pursuit. He succeeded in driving the French from not less than
seven bivouacs, which they had taken up in succession; but each of
which they abandoned the moment they heard the sounds of the Prussian
drums or bugles.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was an hour after midnight when <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> reached Quatre
Bras; whence he despatched several Officers to make known to
<span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> the loss of the Battle, and to order him to retire
upon Namur. The Officers whom he had previously detached from Genappe
to Ligny, for the purpose of moving <span class="smcap">Girard</span>'s Division, which
had been left there, into position at Quatre Bras, now brought him word
that they had not succeeded in finding it. There appeared to be no
possibility of presenting, at this point, any effectual check to the
Prussian pursuit. General <span class="smcap">Nègre</span> of the Artillery was here with
the Parks of Reserve, but accompanied by a very feeble escort.</p>

<p>The Soldiers of the First and Second Corps, who, during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</a></span> the advance
of the 15th, had crossed the Sambre by the Bridge of Marchiennes, had
quitted the high road, both at Quatre Bras and at Gosselies, to proceed
in the direction of that point; and with so much precipitation that
they could not be halted for the purpose of forming something like a
Rear Guard.</p>

<p>The Sixth Corps, the Imperial Guard, and part of the Cavalry, retreated
upon Charleroi, whither <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> himself proceeded; after
having sent his brother <span class="smcap">Jerome</span> to Marchiennes, with Orders to
rally the troops between Avesnes and Maubeuge.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the mean time, <span class="smcap">Gneisenau</span> continued his wild nocturnal
chase, which was truly <i><span class="smcap">Lützow</span>'s wilde verwegene Jagd</i>. His
followers, however, having been on the march or in action, since
daybreak, were becoming weary, especially the Infantry: besides which,
several, impelled by hunger, stopped on the way to plunder provision
waggons; so that their numbers had greatly diminished.</p>

<p>But <span class="smcap">Gneisenau</span>, who was the life and soul of the pursuit, and
who seemed bent on pushing forward whilst a man and horse remained, now
had recourse to a stratagem, which, as regarded its effect upon the
Enemy, fully compensated for the exhaustion of his Infantry. Observing
that the fugitives always took alarm at the sound of the drum, which
announced the presence even of Infantry thus far in pursuit, and close
upon their rear; he ordered the last remaining Drummer, who was unable
to proceed further on foot, to mount one of the horses that had been
disengaged from <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s travelling carriage, and then to
keep up with the Cavalry, and beat the drum without intermission.</p>

<p>In this manner <span class="smcap">Gneisenau</span> passed through Quatre Bras, which
had been abandoned on his approach; and even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span> Heights of Frasne
were left free to him; whilst the affrighted Foe, completely scattered
and dispersed, endeavoured to escape by Gosselies, Marchiennes, and
Charleroi. Upon reaching the Inn of <i>à l'Empereur</i> on the high road
beyond Frasne, this favoured companion of <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> halted his
followers, who then consisted but of a few Squadrons and a party of the
15th Regiment, and allowed them to take rest; satisfied with having
thus, by mere beat of drum and shouts of triumph, succeeded in scaring
the remnant of the French Army across the Sambre.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such was the termination of this ever memorable Battle&mdash;a Battle,
remarkable for the spectacle it afforded, on the one hand, of a bravery
the most noble and undaunted; of a passive endurance, the most calm,
dignified, and sublime; of a loyalty and patriotism, the most stern
and inflexible: and on the other, of a gallantry in assault the most
daring and reckless; of a devotion to their Chief, the most zealous and
unbounded; and, lastly, of a physical overthrow and moral annihilation
unexampled in the history of modern warfare. Such was the consummation
of a victory, the most brilliant in its development, the most decisive
in its operation, and the most comprehensive in its result, of any
that had occurred since the commencement of that Revolution which it
was thus the instrument of bringing to the termination so long and so
ardently desired by the suffering and indignant nations of Europe.</p>

<p>From the contemplation of the triumph, the glory, and the result, of
such a Battle: we are impelled to turn our thoughts upon the melancholy
spectacle of the awfully severe losses sustained by both the victors
and the vanquished; whose heroic exertions and noble endurance could
not but be attended with immense sacrifice.</p>

<p>In the absence of all returns it is difficult to estimate the losses of
the French Army. They were, however, immense; besides which, the whole
of their Artillery, Ammunition Waggons, and Baggage, fell into the
possession of the victors. Of the French Generals, <span class="smcap">Michel</span> and
<span class="smcap">Duhesme</span> were killed; Prince <span class="smcap">Jerome</span>, <span class="smcap">Friant</span>,
and several others were wounded; and <span class="smcap">Lobau</span>, <span class="smcap">Compans</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Cambronne</span>, were taken prisoners.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The minuteness of detail with which the foregoing History of the Battle
of Waterloo has been written, the gradual development which has been
presented of the motives and dispositions of the Commanders, and the
circumstantial description which has been afforded of the movements of
the troops engaged&mdash;of the working, as it were, of the machinery in
the hands of the three most renowned Captains of the Age&mdash;obviate the
necessity of further comment upon those points; but it would be unjust
to the honour, the fame, and the glory, of the actors in that memorable
scene, to omit putting forth certain important considerations which are
essential to enable an impartial public, and an unprejudiced posterity,
to arrive at correct and satisfactory conclusions upon other points,
hitherto involved in doubt and obscurity.</p>

<p>These refer chiefly to the relative numerical strength of the
Combatants, the relative proportions in which the troops of the
Anglo-Allied Army were actively engaged with the Enemy, the conduct of
these troops respectively while so engaged, and lastly the extent of
the actual share taken in the Battle by the Prussians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</a></span></p>

<p>The most simple, and at the same time most rational, mode of computing
the relative strength of Armies is by placing in juxtaposition their
respective numbers of Battalions, Squadrons, and guns. According to
this rule, the Anglo-Allied and French Armies, as they stood in front
of each other at the commencement of the Battle, were constituted as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Almost all these Battalions were at one time or another in the Front
Line, and all conducted themselves in the most courageous and exemplary
manner, with the exception of five of the Dutch-Belgian Battalions,
which hastily retreated as the French approached, when making their
first grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</a></span> attack upon the Anglo-Allied Centre and Left Wing, and
took no further active part in the Battle. The remainder of the above
ten Battalions in the service of the King of the Netherlands, were
three Battalions forming the 2nd Regiment of the Nassau Contingent, and
two Battalions of Orange Nassau, under Prince <span class="smcap">Bernhard</span> of Saxe
Weimar, and occupied the houses and inclosures in the valley in front
of the extreme Left of the Allied Line. These troops behaved extremely
well.</p>

<p>Of the Squadrons above mentioned, a large proportion, nearly one third,
consisted of the Dutch-Belgian Cavalry; but although their numbers
serve to augment the amount of the Anglo-Allied Cavalry <i>on paper</i>,
the actual value of their services in the Battle was by no means
commensurate with their display of strength: and hence it was that
the brunt of the Cavalry contest devolved almost exclusively upon the
British and German Dragoons. The same observation applies in an equal
degree to the Artillery.</p>

<p>About six o'clock, the relative strength of the contending forces
was altered, on the part of the French Army, by the detaching of
<span class="smcap">Lobau</span>'s Corps and the Young Guard to oppose the Prussians;
and on that of the Anglo-Allied Army, though somewhat later, by the
bringing into the Field of <span class="smcap">Chassé</span>'s Dutch-Belgian Division; so
that they stood about that time as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Of the assistance derived by the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> from this
augmentation of the twelve Dutch-Belgian Battalions, a sufficient
estimate may be deduced from the foregoing History of the Battle&mdash;one
half of them were with great difficulty prevented from abandoning the
Field,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</a></span> although, at the moment, they were not in contact with, nor did
they even see, the Enemy; and the other half only joined the Front Line
(on the left of <span class="smcap">Maitland</span>'s Brigade) at the time of the General
Advance.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the cause of the comparative supineness of the
Dutch-Belgian troops; whether produced by dislike entertained towards
recent political arrangements, which alienated each party from its
native country, without, securing to either its national independence;
or, by predilections imbibed for the Chief against whose arms they were
now opposed, and in whose ranks they had formerly served: the fact of
such supineness is too well attested to admit of any doubt respecting
the value to be attached to their co-operation in the great struggle
so courageously and resolutely sustained by the remainder of the
Anglo-Allied Army; and becomes a most important point for consideration
in any calculation of the relative strength of the Combatants, when
taken into conjunction with the actual proportion of the entire
Dutch-Belgian force brought into the Field to that of each of the
Allies, as appears by the following table:&mdash;</p>

<p>Hence it appears that the Dutch-Belgian Contingent, compared with the
British troops alone, consisted, in Infantry, as 13,402 to 15,181; in
Cavalry, as 3,205 to 5,843; and, in guns, as 32 to 78.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is needless now to speculate upon what might have been the result,
had this large proportion of force been replaced by a corresponding
number of either British or German troops. The fact testifies
abundantly, in addition to what has been already related, as to the
heroic firmness and enduring courage with which the brave British
and Germans stood the brunt of that remarkable contest; and this,
too, be it remembered, with unquestionably the finest Army which even
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> had ever collected together, formed exclusively of
one nation&mdash;of that nation whose legions had at one time subjugated
nearly the whole of Europe&mdash;imbued with inveterate hatred against its
foes, cherishing the most enthusiastic devotion to its Chief, and
filled with the ardent desire of restoring the fallen glory of the
Empire.</p>

<p>Of the conduct of the British Infantry, of its heroic valour, its
indomitable resistance, its proud defiance, and its admirable
discipline, the History of the Battle affords abundant testimony:
further comment is superfluous.</p>

<p>The superior prowess of the British Cavalry also shone most
conspicuously on this great day. The combined charge of the two Heavy
Brigades against the French Cavalry and Infantry which attacked the
Centre and Left Wing of the Anglo-Allied Army between one and two
o'clock, whether we regard the brilliancy of its execution, or the
magnitude of its success, is perhaps without a parallel in the last
War: and when we consider the preponderance of the Enemy in this Arm,
the frequency of his charges, and the masses with which he advanced, it
is impossible to advert to the heroism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[Pg 593]</a></span> of Britain's Cavalry, without
at the same time according the praise so pre-eminently due to the
skill of the noble and gallant Chief who was the life and soul of its
movements throughout the arduous and desperate struggle; and who so
judiciously economised its strength, that when at the critical moment
its services were required for securing the victory, he was enabled to
bring forward two fresh Brigades, which fulfilled those services in
a style the most brilliant that can be conceived, and with a success
which commanded the admiration of all who witnessed it.</p>

<p>The British Artillery, which had to contend against an immense
preponderance of metal, evinced during the whole day, a degree
of bravery, zeal, activity, and intelligence, which can never be
surpassed; and nobly sustained its long and honourably acquired
pre-eminence.</p>

<p>Of the troops of the King's German Legion, whether Cavalry, Infantry,
or Artillery, it is impossible to speak in terms of too high praise;
suffice it to remark that their conduct was, in every respect, on a par
with that of the British.</p>

<p>Of the four Hanoverian Infantry Brigades, that of
<span class="smcap">Kielmansegge</span>, and a part of <span class="smcap">Halkett</span>'s, were the
most actively engaged: <span class="smcap">Best</span>'s stood almost the entire day on
the extreme Left of the Front Line of the Anglo-Allied Infantry; and
<span class="smcap">Vincke</span>'s in Reserve in front of Mont St Jean. They had been
but recently and hastily raised; and yet the manner in which such raw
soldiers withstood, as <span class="smcap">Kielmansegge</span>'s Brigade did, for so
great a length of time, the most furious assaults made by the gallant
and well disciplined troops of France, would have conferred honour on
long tried veterans.</p>

<p>The Brunswickers, who were also composed of young soldiers, performed
a glorious part in the Battle; and amply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</a></span> avenged the death of their
Prince. Some of their Battalions were much shaken at the moment
<span class="smcap">Alten</span>'s Division was driven back a short distance; but they
speedily rallied, and resumed their lost ground. Altogether, their
bravery, which was frequently called into action; and their endurance,
which was severely tested, merited the strongest commendation.</p>

<p>The troops constituting the Nassau Brigade under <span class="smcap">Kruse</span> (or
more properly the 1st Regiment of the Nassau Contingent), were attached
to <span class="smcap">Alten</span>'s Division. They were consequently often in the thick
of the fight; and though, on the occasion above alluded to, they were
thrown into disorder and driven in by a furious onset of the Enemy,
they conducted themselves generally throughout the day with great
steadiness and bravery.</p>

<p>It is impossible to allude in terms of adequate praise to the services
of that most important branch of the Army, the General Staff; the
Officers of which distinguished themselves no less by the zeal, the
daring, and the activity, with which they carried into execution
the commands of their respective Chiefs, than by the alacrity and
intelligence which they evinced in catching and imparting the true
spirit of their instructions. The constant exposure to which their
peculiar duties necessarily subjected them could not but entail upon
them severe losses. Few indeed were those who escaped unhurt throughout
this arduous conflict.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The co-operation of the Prussians in this Battle has been gradually
developed and fully detailed. That the communications which
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span> received from <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> led him to expect
that co-operation at a much earlier period, is beyond a doubt; but
setting aside all consideration of the causes of the delay which
attended the arrival of the Prussian forces, it is equally doubtless
that the tardiness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</a></span> that co-operation had a more decided influence
on the general result of the Battle than if they had reached the Field
at an earlier period.</p>

<p>For, supposing the Prussians to have arrived in force before the
French had become so seriously and desperately engaged with the
Anglo-Allied Army, <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> was too much a Master of his
art to have risked a decisive Battle with the combined forces of his
antagonists. In this case he would, in all probability, have fallen
back upon his frontier, have called in all available Reserves from
the interior, and by means of his Triple Line of Fortresses, as well
as by skilful man&oelig;uvring, have endeavoured to separate once more
the opposing Armies, and to obtain another chance of beating them in
detail. As it happened, however, he was too deeply involved in the
contest with <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>; he had suffered too severely in his
repeated attacks, to admit of a retreat, under such circumstances,
being looked upon, even by his friends in Paris, in any other light
than that of a defeat: and he knew too well that with a defeat, however
it might be produced, would vanish the only tie which yet bound him
to the nation&mdash;the implied belief in his invincibility, and the firm
reliance on his ability to re-establish and maintain the military
glory of France. It is to this conviction alone that we can attribute
the desperate resolve with which he risked the fate of the Empire and
his own political existence upon the issue of his final attack upon
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Line, at a moment when the Armies opposed to him
had effected their junction; and which, by calling the whole of his
force into requisition, deprived him of an adequate Reserve, by aid of
which he might have succeeded in effecting an orderly and honourable
retreat.</p>

<p>Had the Prussians succeeded in driving the French out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</a></span> of Planchenoit
half an hour earlier: such a circumstance, combined with the General
Advance of the Anglo-Allied Line, would no doubt have caused the whole
of <span class="smcap">Lobau</span>'s Corps, and perhaps also <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s, to
lay down their arms and surrender at discretion; since their retreat
towards Maison du Roi would thus have been cut off, whilst the British
Advance would have frustrated any attempt to retire across the
Charleroi road. On the other hand, a similar result might have ensued,
at least as regards <span class="smcap">Lobau</span>'s Corps, had that General Advance
occurred half an hour earlier; while the French Right was engaged with
the Prussians at a greater distance from the Charleroi road.</p>

<p>In the former case, however, the final attack was judiciously
delayed until, by the arrival of the additional force which was fast
approaching, such a simultaneous attack could be made along the
whole of the French Right as would insure most decided success: and
in the latter case, the final attack could not have been made at a
more opportune moment, and with a greater prospect of success, than
immediately after the signal defeat of the French Imperial Guard upon
the Anglo-Allied position. Indeed, contingencies of this kind might
be brought forward with reference to any Battle whatever; and when it
is considered that there exists no example in modern warfare of so
complete a victory, the result must appear as glorious, as decisive,
and as comprehensive, as the most stern and rigid calculator of the
chances of Battle could have desired.</p>

<p>As regards the actual share which the Prussians had in the Battle,
it may be truly affirmed that the contest maintained between
<span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Corps and <span class="smcap">Lobau</span>'s troops in conjunction with
a portion of the Imperial Guard, was most obstinate and sanguinary.
In the Three successive struggles for the possession of Planchenoit,
especially, the deadly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</a></span> animosity mutually cherished by the troops of
both nations, was fearfully exemplified; and the losses sustained by
the Prussians in the comparatively brief period during which they were
engaged, afforded ample proof of the value of their co-operation. It
is undeniably true that the blow which decided the victory was that
given by <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, when, after having completely defeated
the grand attack by the French Imperial Guard, he instantly followed
up that defeat by boldly attacking and penetrating the Centre of the
Enemy's Lines, and sustaining this movement by the General Advance of
his whole Army; but it is at the same time, equally true, that the
powerful diversion effected by the Prussians diminished the strength
of those French Lines by the Corps of <span class="smcap">Lobau</span> which had not
hitherto fired a single shot in this Campaign, by twelve Battalions of
the Imperial Guard which had suffered scarcely any loss at Ligny, and,
finally, by eighteen Squadrons of Cavalry.</p>

<p>The vigorous attack which was made by <span class="smcap">Bülow</span> upon
<span class="smcap">Lobau</span>'s Line, simultaneously with the last assault upon
Planchenoit, contributed most materially to the general and fatal panic
which seized upon the whole of the French Army. The Prussians too, by
the energetic pursuit which they kept up during the night, under the
guidance of the indefatigable <span class="smcap">Gneisenau</span>, rendered the victory
still more complete and decisive; and effectually deprived the Enemy
of every opportunity of recovering himself on the Belgian side of the
frontier.</p>

<p>In short, both Armies admirably and honourably performed the parts
respectively assigned to them&mdash;the one holding its defensive position
with unparalleled bravery and unmitigated perseverance until the
moment when its Chief, having defeated the last desperate attempt of
his opponent to force his Line, leads it on to victory; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[Pg 598]</a></span> other
operating a powerful diversion, by which the effect of that Advance
is made still more decisive; and rendering the victory complete by a
harassing and vigorous pursuit&mdash;and thus was consummated the tactical
solution of the plan which had been, with so much skill and foresight,
strategically preconcerted by the Allied Commanders.</p>

<p>The Duke, when writing his Despatch descriptive of the Battle, in which
he stated that his own Army "never, upon any occasion, conducted itself
better," was not unmindful of the important aid he had derived from the
Prussians. "I should not," he said, "do justice to my own feelings,
or to Marshal <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> and the Prussian Army, if I did not
attribute the successful result of this arduous day to the cordial
and timely assistance I received from them. The operation of General
<span class="smcap">Bülow</span> upon the Enemy's Flank was a most decisive one; and,
even if I had not found myself in a situation to make the attack which
produced the final result, it would have forced the Enemy to retire
if his attacks should have failed, and would have prevented him from
taking advantage of them if they should unfortunately have succeeded."</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Prince, although, as is manifest upon a
perusal of a similar despatch on his part, he was not aware of the
circumstances under which <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> had attacked the very
Centre of the French Lines, and had pushed his Advanced Brigades
along the rear of those troops to which he himself had been exposed,
nevertheless did ample justice to the bravery of the British Army,
which, he remarked, "fought with a valour which it is impossible to
surpass."</p>

<p>Long may Great Britain and Prussia cherish that mutual amity which was
engendered by the zealous and successful co-operation of the Armies of
these two great nations in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[Pg 599]</a></span> bringing to so prompt and satisfactory a
termination a War which (originating in the reassumption of the throne
of France by that ambitious soldier and extraordinary man who had once
already overrun the Continent with his legions, subjugating Emperors
and Kings to the influence of his mighty will) threatened once more
to involve the nations in all the calamities and horrors which before
had followed in the train of his triumphant but desolating career. The
general Peace, which was the ultimate result of their united efforts,
still happily continues; and on every successive anniversary do the
British and German troops commemorate their glorious and crowning
victory; and Europe, grateful for the lasting and inestimable blessings
conferred upon her, emblazons forth in the pages of her history, the
heroic deeds of the defenders of her liberty and independence.</p>

<p class="ph2"><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></p>


<p class="drop">IT was explained at the conclusion of the Eighth Chapter that
<span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>, who had been ordered by <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> to defend
the position of Wavre in the event of the Enemy advancing in force,
or, if otherwise, to follow the main Army in the direction of Couture,
was on the point of fulfilling the instructions appertaining to the
latter contingency, when <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>'s Corps arrived in front of
that position, about four o'clock in the afternoon, and its Artillery
immediately opened a cannonade upon the Prussian troops.</p>

<p>All the Brigades (the Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, and Twelfth) of
<span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s Corps, had, at that time, received the Order
to commence the general movement to the right. A Detachment of only
two Battalions (the Fusilier Battalions of the 30th Regiment and of
the 1st Kurmark Landwehr), under Colonel <span class="smcap">Zepelin</span>, from the
Ninth Brigade, which had not yet crossed the Dyle, was to be left in
occupation of Wavre. The Twelfth Brigade was already in full line of
march, and the Eleventh had been just put in motion.</p>

<p>When General <span class="smcap">Borcke</span>, who commanded the Ninth Brigade, fell
back upon Wavre, for the purpose of carrying out his instructions, he
found the Bridge already barricaded, and therefore proceeded with his
Brigade to Bas Wavre: and having crossed the Dyle at this point, left
a Detachment there, consisting of the Sharpshooters of the Fusilier
Battalion of the 8th Regiment, and of those of the 1st Battalion of
the 30th Regiment, under Major <span class="smcap">Ditfurth</span>; whom he directed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</a></span>
to destroy the Bridge immediately. He then detached the 2nd Battalion
of the 30th Regiment and his two Squadrons of the Kurmark Landwehr
Cavalry, as a reinforcement to Colonel <span class="smcap">Zepelin</span> at Wavre; and,
with the remainder of his Brigade, continued his march.</p>

<p>In the mean time, French <i>Tirailleurs</i> were observed extending along
the opposite Heights; and, in their rear, considerable masses of the
Enemy's troops appeared advancing. It soon became manifest that they
contemplated forcing the passage of the river.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>, judging by the want of vigour displayed in the
French pursuit; and by the Enemy not having attempted to secure the
passage of the Dyle at Moustier, Limelette, and Limale, that it was
only a weak Detachment of the Enemy that was advancing upon Wavre,
confining itself to the design of creating some little uneasiness by
its movement along this road to Brussels, had hitherto been of opinion
that the occupation of Wavre by a few Battalions, as directed by
<span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, would be quite sufficient: but he now plainly saw
that the moment had arrived which required him, in pursuance of his
instructions, to maintain the position at Wavre; and he accordingly
ordered the halt of his whole Corps for this purpose.</p>

<p>The town of Wavre is situated on the left bank of the Dyle: having a
suburb on the opposite side of the river, with which it is connected by
two stone Bridges; the principal one leading towards the middle, and a
small one towards the upper end, of the Town. Higher up the stream, at
the Mill of Bierge, at Limale, and at Limelette; as also below the town
at Bas Wavre, there are wooden Bridges. The river is not deep, but at
the period of the Battle it was swollen by the recent heavy rain. The
low range of Heights on either side of the Valley is covered in many
places with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[Pg 603]</a></span> wood. The Heights on the right bank are generally more
elevated, but those on the left have steeper declivities, and offer a
greater command of the river and its passages. The shortest road from
Namur to Brussels passes through the town, besides which there are
numerous cross roads practicable for the movement of all Arms. The
great number of hollow ways forms a prominent feature in the vicinity;
and these, being in a miry state from the rain, were unfavourable to
the progress of troops passing through them.</p>

<p>The position was thus occupied:&mdash;the Twelfth Brigade (Colonel
<span class="smcap">Stülpnagel</span>), with the Horse Battery No. 20, was posted on
the Height in rear of Bierge. The Bridge in front of this Village was
barricaded, and the Mill occupied for the defence of the Bridge. The
Tenth Brigade (Colonel <span class="smcap">Kämpfen</span>) stood upon the Height in
rear of Wavre, its Right resting on a Wood which lay between it and
the Twelfth Brigade. The Eleventh Brigade (Colonel <span class="smcap">Luck</span>) was
formed across the Brussels road. The Reserve Cavalry was drawn up, near
La Bavette, in Columns of Squadrons. The Artillery was distributed
along the Heights. The Horse Battery No. 18 remained in reserve.</p>

<p>That part of the town of Wavre which lies on the right bank, or,
more properly, the suburb, was occupied by Light Troops only. The
great Bridge was barricaded as well as time and circumstances would
admit. The houses adjoining the left bank of the river were hastily
loopholed. The smaller Bridge was left perfectly open. A Detachment of
two Companies of Light Infantry, under Major <span class="smcap">Bornstädt</span> was
detached to reinforce the troops at the Bridge of Bas Wavre.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thielemann</span> intended that the Ninth Brigade should be posted in
rear of this general disposition of his troops, so that its services
might be made available according as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[Pg 604]</a></span> circumstances might require; but
through some misunderstanding in the transmission of the Order, General
<span class="smcap">Borcke</span> was induced, after having moved along the Brussels road
until near La Bavette, thence to turn off to his left, and continue
his march, according to his original instructions, in the direction of
Fromont, Bourgeois, and St Lambert, towards Couture; being under the
impression that the whole Corps had already commenced this march, in
pursuance of the general plan, and that his Brigade was destined to
cover the movement. The departure of the Brigade was not immediately
discovered; and thus, by this misunderstanding, <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s
force suffered an unexpected reduction of six Battalions and the Foot
Battery No. 18; and consisted, therefore, of only 15,200 men; with
which number he had now to contend against Marshal <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s
force, amounting altogether to 33,765 men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s position was certainly a very favourable one,
and the occupation of it was arranged with great skill. As it was
impossible to foresee in what manner the attack upon it would be
conducted; whether it would be directed against one particular Bridge,
or against all the Bridges, with the design of carrying the whole Line
by storm: <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span> limited the occupation of the town and
of the line of the river to the number of Light Troops which might
be sufficient for sustaining any sudden assault; taking care to have
Supports close at hand for that purpose: but disposing his Reserves,
which comprised his main force, so that they might become available at
any point which might be pressed; or, should the Enemy develop greatly
superior numbers, as was subsequently the case, serve to guard against
any flank attack.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As before explained, it was <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>'s Corps which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[Pg 605]</a></span> arrived
in front of Wavre between three and four o'clock. Two Batteries, of
which one consisted of twelve pounders, were drawn up on the right of
the road overlooking the valley, and opened the cannonade. These were
subsequently reinforced by a third Battery, posted on the left of the
road. <span class="smcap">Excelmans</span>' Cavalry Corps was posted in right rear of
<span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>. <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>, with the Fourth French Corps, was
still in the rear on the march; and <span class="smcap">Pajol</span>, with his Light
Cavalry, had only just passed through Tourrines, situated scarcely half
way between Gembloux and Wavre. Marshal <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> sent word to
both these Officers to accelerate their march.</p>

<p>Whilst the French Skirmishers were gradually forcing back the Prussian
Light Troops into the valley, <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>, hearing a powerful
cannonade in the distance to his left, rode off a little way in that
direction; and concluding that <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> was closely engaged
with <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, conceived that as he had now reached the
Prussians, he would best fulfil his instructions by vigorously
attacking them, so as to prevent their detaching reinforcements to
the Anglo-Allied Army. He was quite ignorant as to the strength of
the Enemy in his front, and was in doubt whether the whole Prussian
Army was before him, or merely a strong Detachment. Of the fact
that three Prussian Corps were on the march to co-operate with
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s forces, he of course knew nothing. In this state
of uncertainty, and with his troops <i>aux prises</i> with the Prussians,
he was fearful of detaching to his left; since by so doing, he would
expose himself to the risk of his main force becoming overpowered by
superior numbers, and his Detachment cut off.</p>

<p>Independently of other considerations which might have assisted in
dissuading <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> from detaching a portion of his force at
this period, such as the length of time his troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</a></span> had been upon the
march, along bad and miry roads; he was perfectly justified, under
all the circumstances of his then position, in adopting this course
of proceeding. And even if he had been fully cognisant of the actual
disposition of the Prussian Army, he could at this time have rendered
no essential service to <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>; the opportunity for doing so
had been suffered to pass by, as was fully explained in Chapter VIII.</p>

<p>His total ignorance, however, of <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s proceedings, and of
all that was then taking place between Wavre and the Field of Waterloo,
afforded undeniable proof of his having completely failed in acting up
to the spirit of the instructions he had received, not to lose sight
of the Prussians, and in exercising that degree of enterprise, energy,
and decision, which <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> had so naturally anticipated
from a General of <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s note and experience; especially
when entrusted with so important a command, under such highly critical
circumstances.</p>

<p>A message having reached <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> from <span class="smcap">Pajol</span>,
communicating his having fallen into the Marshal's line of operation,
he directed that General to move upon Limale. His Right Flank, however,
continued to be protected by the 17th Dragoons, detached from General
<span class="smcap">Berton</span>'s Cavalry Brigade (of <span class="smcap">Excelmans</span>' Corps) <i>en
reconnaissance</i>, towards the high road leading from Namur to Louvain.</p>

<p>In the mean time, a vigorous cannonade was maintained between
<span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>'s and the Prussian Batteries across that part of the
valley in which lay the town of Wavre. Under cover of the French guns,
the Skirmishers pressed down upon that portion of the town situated
upon the right bank of the river, and of which they soon gained
possession; the Prussians having previously decided upon not making
any effort to retain it. On reaching the river, however, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[Pg 607]</a></span> were
met by a most destructive fire of musketry from the opposite houses
and the Bridge. The contest now became desperate, and the defence of
the Dyle was obstinately maintained by the Prussians. The Skirmishers
rapidly extended on either Flank along both banks of the river from
Bierge as far as Bas Wavre. All the Prussian Brigades pushed forward
their Sharpshooters. Those of the 4th Kurmark Landwehr took up the Line
between the Town and Bas Wavre, those of the 3rd Kurmark Landwehr took
post in the Town, between the two Bridges; on the right of the latter
stood the Sharpshooters of the Tenth Brigade; and those of the Twelfth
Brigade formed the Right Wing of the whole Line at Bierge.</p>

<p>This <i>tiraillade</i> had continued about an hour, when General
<span class="smcap">Hulot</span>'s Division of <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>'s <i>Corps d'Armée</i>
reached the Field; and received Orders to take possession of the
Mill at Bierge, and to cross the Dyle at that point. A Battalion of
<span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>'s Corps was at the time vainly attempting to effect a
passage. Upon the Height opposite Bierge were several guns of the Third
Corps, endeavouring to keep down the fire from the Prussian Batteries
on the other side of the valley.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> desired <span class="smcap">Gérard</span> to relieve the Battalion
attacking the Mill at Bierge by one of his own Corps; whereupon the
latter directed General <span class="smcap">Hulot</span> to push forward with a Battalion
of the 9th Light Infantry for that purpose. The Battalion descended
into the valley, covered by the fire from the guns on the Height. Its
advance was much impeded by the swampy nature of the ground at the foot
of the declivity, and by the numerous broad and deep drains by which
the valley is intersected: and its order was still further deranged by
the fire from the Artillery on the opposite Heights, as also by that of
the Prussian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[Pg 608]</a></span> Skirmishers posted along the left bank of the river, and
strongly occupying the Mill. The banks of the river at this part, more
particularly the left bank, are mostly lined with trees; which tended
still further to increase the means of resistance on the part of the
Prussians to the advance of the French troops. The latter on reaching
the Mill, and relieving <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>'s troops, made an attack; but
without success.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> was on the point of ordering this attack to
be renewed, when he received, between six and seven o'clock,
<span class="smcap">Soult</span>'s despatch, addressed to him from the Field of Waterloo
at one o'clock in the afternoon: and desiring him to man&oelig;uvre always
in that direction, to maintain a close communication with the main
Army, and to lose not a moment in joining the latter, and attacking
<span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s <i>Corps d'Armée</i>; which, it added, could then be seen
upon the Heights of St Lambert.</p>

<p>The circumstances in which <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> found himself at the
time this despatch reached him, held out no prospect of his being
able to fulfil, even partially, the instructions which it contained.
<span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>'s efforts to force the Bridges of Wavre, and to
capture the Town, were completely frustrated by the most gallant
defence maintained on the part of the Prussians. The issue of the
attack upon the Mill of Bierge appeared very doubtful. Neither the main
body of <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>'s Corps, nor General <span class="smcap">Teste</span>'s Division
of the Sixth Corps, nor even <span class="smcap">Pajol</span>'s Light Cavalry, had as yet
arrived.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>, becoming impatient, rode hastily towards La Baraque,
accompanied by <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>, to meet the first mentioned force; and
on coming up with the Columns, directed their march upon Limale, his
object now being to turn the Right of <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s position,
and to prevent the retreat of the latter upon Brussels, and at the same
time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[Pg 609]</a></span> open his direct road to St Lambert. This he might succeed in
effecting; but it is sufficiently evident from the above view of his
position, at so late an hour of the day, that any important diversion
on his part in favour of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, was quite out of the
question.</p>

<p>On returning with <span class="smcap">Gérard</span> to Wavre, <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> found that
notwithstanding the furious assaults that were made in rapid succession
upon the Bridges, supported by the vigorous cannonade from the Heights,
and the incessant fusillade along the banks of the river, no further
progress was effected. As if determined that the passage should be
forced, he dismounted from his horse, and placing himself at the head
of a Battalion, led on another attack upon the Mill of Bierge. But the
bravery of the troops, though so strongly excited by the noble example
of the Marshal, could avail nothing against the indomitable resistance
of the Prussian defenders of this important Post. <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>, who
had accompanied the Marshal in this attack, fell severely wounded by a
shot which struck him in the breast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> now decided upon leaving <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>'s Corps
and <span class="smcap">Excelmans</span>' Cavalry in front of Wavre and Bierge; and
proceeding himself with that portion of <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>'s troops which
was at hand, along the right bank of the Dyle, towards Limale, and
uniting them to the remainder of the Corps which had been ordered to
march in the direction of that point from La Baraque. This movement
occupied considerable time, in consequence of the difficulties opposed
to the march of troops along the side of the river. At length, having,
arrived in front of Limale, and formed a junction with <span class="smcap">Pajol</span>'s
Cavalry, preparations were made for an attack.</p>

<p>Limale was at that time occupied by Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Stengel</span>
with the three Battalions of the 19th Prussian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[Pg 610]</a></span> Regiment, two Squadrons
of the 6th Uhlans, and one Squadron of the Westphalian Landwehr
Cavalry. It was the Detachment left by <span class="smcap">Zieten</span> for the purpose
of covering the Left Flank of the Third <i>Corps d'Armée</i>. It had
unaccountably neglected to adopt any measures for barricading the
Bridge; the defence of which, if conducted with the same energy and
resolution by which that of the Bridges lower down the stream had been
distinguished, might have been the means of preventing the French from
crossing the Dyle at all on that day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pajol</span>, having reconnoitred the place and discovered his
neglect, succeeded in gaining possession of the Bridge by means
of a brisk Cavalry attack. <span class="smcap">Hulot</span>'s Infantry Division of
<span class="smcap">Gérard</span>'s Corps reached it shortly afterwards; and it was
soon made manifest to Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Stengel</span> that he was
attacked by a force much superior to his own. Nevertheless he continued
to fall gradually back, in good order, until <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span> pushed
forward the Twelfth Brigade to his support. Three Battalions of the
Tenth Brigade moved into the position thus vacated by the Twelfth:
and a general movement was made to the right by all the troops that
could be spared from the defence of Wavre and Bierge. The 4th Kurmark
Landwehr, belonging to the Eleventh Brigade, crossed the Brussels road.
The Reserve Cavalry was ordered to move upon Limale, in support of the
Twelfth Brigade.</p>

<p>When Colonel <span class="smcap">Stülpnagel</span> was ordered to move his Brigade
(the Twelfth) upon Limale, he left three Battalions for the defence
of Bierge. With the remaining six Battalions he came up close to the
Enemy, who was posted on a Height in advance of Limale, his Left
thrown considerably forward and covered by his Cavalry, and his
Right resting upon some houses which he had occupied with Infantry.
This Line,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[Pg 611]</a></span> which was perpendicular to the direction of the original
position of the Prussians, had been taken up with great skill by
<span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>, notwithstanding the difficulties with which the
movement had been attended. His troops had to ascend the Heights during
the obscurity of the night, in rear of Limale, by a narrow, rugged
road, in the immediate proximity of the Prussians, whose fire reached
the head of the Defile: and he was fully occupied until a very late
hour, in posting the Battalions in their proper places, as they filed
out of the road, on reaching the Height; whilst, in the mean time,
<span class="smcap">Pajol</span>'s Light Cavalry pushed rapidly round by the left.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Stülpnagel</span> posted the Fusilier Battalion of the 5th
Kurmark Landwehr, and his Battery, in reserve, in rear of the small
Wood on the right of Bierge, and advanced to the attack, late as it
was, with his five remaining Battalions, having Lieutenant Colonel
<span class="smcap">Stengel</span> with his Detachment on the right. The darkness of the
night prevented the Prussians from correctly ascertaining the position
and strength of the French; but nevertheless it was decided that an
attempt should be made to regain Limale, and drive back the Enemy
across the Dyle.</p>

<p>The attack was thus formed. Two Battalions in front, closely followed
by the remaining three Battalions. Both the Brigade Squadrons joined
the three Squadrons under Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Stengel</span>; and
the whole of the Reserve Cavalry formed in support. In this movement,
however, the mutual connection of the advancing troops was greatly
impeded by the darkness of the night. The two Battalions in Front Line
were on the point of passing a hollow way when they received a volley
from two French Battalions on the opposite side, by which their further
advance was checked. The three Battalions of the Second Line had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[Pg 612]</a></span>
inclined too much to the left, where they became engaged with French
<i>Tirailleurs</i>. Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Stengel</span>'s Detachment, in
attempting to push forward, was checked by the French Cavalry; and
as the latter made a disposition which menaced his Right Flank, that
Officer fell back with his Detachment as far as the Wood near Point du
Jour.</p>

<p>The decided failure of the attack induced Colonel <span class="smcap">Stülpnagel</span>
to withdraw all his troops to the Wood, leaving only the 1st Battalion
of the 6th Kurmark Landwehr in support of the chain of Advanced Posts.
The Reserve Cavalry bivouacked in rear of the Wood. Thus ended the
contest on this part of the Field. The Prussian and French Picquets
were so close to one another during the night, that the Patrols were
constantly clashing, and the whole Line kept upon the <i>qui vive</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Upon the Prussian Left, the conflict for the possession of the town
and Bridges of Wavre continued to be carried on with unabated fury on
both sides until late in the night. <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span> devoted the whole
of his Corps to the attack; constantly pushing forward fresh troops
to relieve those who had failed in their attempts to dislodge the
Prussians. The latter, who exhibited on this occasion an extraordinary
degree of bravery and resolution, succeeded in repelling no less than
thirteen different assaults; and even dislodged, in five instances,
the French from the houses they occupied, from the commencement, on
the right bank of the Dyle. At one time the French had already gained
possession of the great Bridge and some houses on the left bank,
when they were driven back again to their own side of the river by
the Prussian Reserves&mdash;these having advanced to the relief of their
comrades. The struggle was desperate, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[Pg 613]</a></span> apparently interminable.
When the French attacked the houses nearest the Bridge they succeeded
in bursting open the doors, and by superiority of numbers, in
possessing themselves of the ground floors. But even this did not
induce the heroic defenders to relax their exertions; on the contrary,
with increased fury, they defended the upper storeys of the houses, and
held out most gallantly until relieved by the arrival of their Supports.</p>

<p>This brilliant defence of Wavre was distinguished, on the part of the
Prussians, not only by the unflinching bravery of the troops, but also
by the judicious disposal of the Reserves; by means of which the Enemy
was foiled in every attempt to gain a permanent footing in the town.
While the Skirmishers and their Supports were posted along the Dyle
and the adjacent houses, the Reserves were concealed in the nearest
streets, that lay in a direction parallel with that of the river:
and at the moment the French Columns of Attack, already crippled by
the fire concentrated from the Skirmishers, endeavoured to force the
Bridge; these Reserves rushed forward from their cover in the side
streets, and presenting themselves in mass before the Enemy, invariably
drove them back with great slaughter.</p>

<p>It was in this manner that the Fusilier Battalion of the 30th Regiment,
under Major <span class="smcap">Sprenger</span>, and the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Kurmark
Landwehr, under Major <span class="smcap">Bornstädt</span>, constantly repulsed, with
admirable bravery, the attacks made with such superior numbers during
the earlier part of the contest. One of these attacks having been
attended with a somewhat favourable result, the 2nd Battalion of the
30th Regiment, under Major <span class="smcap">Beaufort</span>, was brought forward; and,
at a similarly critical moment, the 1st Battalion of the 4th Kurmark
Landwehr, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[Pg 615]</a></span> Major <span class="smcap">Grolman</span>, came up; when both Battalions
succeeded in compelling the Enemy to retire.</p>

<p>These Battalions then took post in the streets lying parallel with
the river, in the manner before explained; and, with heroic courage,
overcame every renewed attempt on the part of the French to establish
themselves in the town. When, finally, it is considered that from four
o'clock until night, four Prussian Battalions successfully maintained
their ground against a whole <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, with which they were
constantly and desperately engaged during the whole of that period; the
merits of Colonel <span class="smcap">Zepelin</span> and his brave troops are beyond all
praise, and present one of the brightest examples of the defence of a
town and of the passage of a river, recorded in military history.</p>

<a id="illus28" name="illus28"></a> </p>
<p class="caption">Battle of Wavre</p>



<p>Both the Bridges of Wavre remained in the possession of the Prussians,
and the smaller one was barricaded during the night.</p>

<p>At a late hour, as the fire on both sides began to slacken, the
combatants bivouacked on their respective sides of the river. Upon
the Prussian extreme Left at Bas Wavre, the French had only shown one
Battalion. This occupied an isolated building, and was supported by
two Squadrons and a piece of artillery. Several unsuccessful attempts
were made to gain the Bridge; which, at nightfall, continued in the
possession of the Prussians.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> was occupied late in the night in making his
preparations for renewing the attack on the following morning. General
<span class="smcap">Teste</span>'s Division of the Sixth Corps having at length arrived,
his Left Wing, which was thus considerably reinforced, bivouacked
upon the Height westward of Bierge; separated by this Village and the
Dyle from his Right Wing which lay in front of Wavre. He had not yet
received any intelligence of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s signal defeat at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[Pg 616]</a></span>
Waterloo; and was therefore resolved upon following up, at daybreak,
the advantages he had already gained, by forcing back the Prussian
Right Flank.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>, on the contrary, having despatched an Officer of
<span class="smcap">Marwitz</span>'s Cavalry Brigade <i>en reconnaissance</i> to the right,
ascertained through this means that the Allied Armies had gained a
complete victory; and he therefore fully expected that <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>
would be compelled to effect an immediate retreat.</p>

<p>With the first dawn of the 19th of June, Colonel <span class="smcap">Stengel</span>,
whose Detachment was posted on the extreme Right of
<span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s Corps, took upon himself to march off by St
Lambert, to join his <i>Corps d'Armée</i> (the First); the grounds for which
proceeding remain to the present time as unaccountable as his neglect
on the previous day to secure the Bridge of Limale. In consequence
of this movement, the Twelfth Brigade was necessitated to extend its
Line too much to the right and to retain a Reserve of only three weak
Battalions upon the road leading through the Wood to Point du Jour. The
Wood to the right was occupied by a Battalion and two Companies from
each of the remaining Regiments of the Twelfth Brigade. The Left Wing
of this Line, which rested upon Bierge, was formed by six Battalions of
the Tenth Brigade.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">Luck</span>, commanding the Eleventh Brigade, was directed
to support this Division, which was much too weak, with the three
Battalions of the 3rd Kurmark Landwehr; but to leave the two Battalions
of the 4th Kurmark Landwehr, as also the Brigade Squadrons, in rear of
Wavre, in a hollow near the Windmill, where they served to cover the
twelve pounder Battery No. 7.</p>

<p>The Mill of Bierge was occupied by two Battalions of the Twelfth
Brigade: Wavre and Bas Wavre were held by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[Pg 617]</a></span> same troops which
defended those points on the previous day. The barricades and
preparations for defence were rendered more complete.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Ledebur</span>, whose Detachment, consisting of
the 10th Hussars, a Squadron of Landwehr Cavalry, and two guns from the
Horse Battery No. 12, had formed on the 18th the Advance of the Rear
Guard which <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s Corps was considered to constitute,
having reached St Lambert before <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s attack became so
decided, remained there during the night.</p>

<p>Early on the 19th, <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> sent off three Cavalry Regiments
to his left to watch these troops. They showed no indication of an
intention to attack; and when, later in the day, they retired and
disappeared from <span class="smcap">Ledebur</span>'s view, the latter passed the Defile,
for the purpose of proceeding to join his <i>Corps d'Armée</i> (the Fourth),
which, however, he did not reach before the 20th.</p>

<p>This, as well as Colonel <span class="smcap">Stengel</span>'s Detachment, thus
withdrew from the Field, without any apparent necessity, reducing
<span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s numbers, already too weak, and taking up a line
of march, along which their services were comparatively useless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>, concluding from the account that he had received
of the defeat of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, that the French would commence a
retreat, renewed the combat at daybreak by an attack with his Cavalry.
Colonel <span class="smcap">Marwitz</span> was sent forward, with the 8th Uhlans and two
Squadrons of the 6th Kurmark Landwehr Cavalry, towards the plateau
above Limale, occupied by <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s Left Wing: whilst General
<span class="smcap">Hobe</span> followed this movement with the 5th and 7th Uhlans, and
formed up on the left of the Advanced Cavalry. The 5th Uhlans were
immediately afterwards advantageously posted in a hollow in support of
Colonel <span class="smcap">Marwitz</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[Pg 618]</a></span></p>

<p>The Horse Battery No. 20, subsequently reinforced by the Foot Battery
No. 18, opened a cannonade upon the Enemy's Columns at the plateau;
which displayed a great superiority of numbers, and were supported by a
considerable force of Cavalry. The preponderating number of guns in the
Enemy's Line answered the fire of the Prussians with great vigour; and
as the intervening space was very limited, the numbers of killed and
wounded were very great. The Prussian Artillery lost five guns on this
occasion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> delayed not a moment in making dispositions for an
attack on his part. His force on this side of the Field consisted of
the three Divisions of <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>'s Corps, and of <span class="smcap">Teste</span>'s
Division of the Sixth Corps. The latter and two of the former
were posted in Front Line; the remaining Division, in Reserve. He
formed three Columns of Attack. That on the right consisted of
<span class="smcap">Teste</span>'s Division, and was directed upon Bierge; the central
Column was put in motion against the Prussian Centre; and that on the
left against the Right of the Prussian formation.</p>

<p>The head of each Column was accompanied by a Battery, and preceded by a
swarm of Skirmishers. At the same time, <span class="smcap">Pajol</span> put his Cavalry
in motion, and threatened to turn the Prussian Right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thielemann</span> resolved upon not only offering to the Enemy a
vigorous opposition; but also upon assuming the offensive himself,
and immediately gave the necessary Orders for that purpose. He also
reinforced his Right with two more Companies, and his Left with an
additional Battalion.</p>

<p>It was soon made manifest, however, that this attack failed to check
the forward movement of the Enemy. The ten Prussian Battalions were
forced to give way to the advance of twenty two French Battalions,
which were followed by six more in support. The French gained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[Pg 619]</a></span>
possession of that part of the Wood of Rixansart which was on the right
of the Prussian position, and drove back the Twelfth Brigade. The
Battalions of the latter collected again immediately in rear of the
Wood, under the protection of the three before mentioned Battalions of
the Eleventh Brigade and of a Battery of fifteen guns.</p>

<p>General <span class="smcap">Teste</span>'s Division had in the mean time attacked
Bierge, which was bravely defended by the two Battalions of the
Kurmark Landwehr. Whilst the engagement continued at this point,
<span class="smcap">Thielemann</span> took up a second position in rear of the first,
with four Battalions of the Tenth Brigade, and occupied the small
Wood in rear of Bierge. The Prussian Cavalry Brigade, under Colonels
<span class="smcap">Marwitz</span> and Count <span class="smcap">Lottum</span>, comprising twelve
Squadrons, secured the right towards Chambre.</p>

<p>About eight o'clock, just as this position had been taken up,
<span class="smcap">Thielemann</span> received, through General <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>, the
decisive and authentic intelligence that a great victory had been
gained by the Allies on the previous day, as also a communication of
the fact of the Second <i>Corps d'Armée</i> having marched to intercept
<span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s retreat upon the Sambre. Advantage was immediately
taken of these joyful tidings to raise the spirits of the troops, and
to excite them to a renewed attack. With loud cheers the Prussian
Batteries advanced to the attack; which was attended with complete
success, and even the Wood of Rixansart was again taken.</p>

<p>The Enemy appeared irresolute, and as if impressed with the idea that
<span class="smcap">Thielemann</span> had received reinforcements; but observing that
no further progress was made, he renewed the attack on his part, and
retook the Wood of Rixansart.</p>

<p>It was not until about this time&mdash;towards nine o'clock&mdash;that
<span class="smcap">Teste</span>'s Division gained possession of the Village of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[Pg 620]</a></span> Bierge;
on which occasion General <span class="smcap">Penne</span>, an Officer of considerable
distinction in the French Army, was killed. The French were prevented
for some time from debouching from the place, by the determined
opposition of the <i>Tirailleurs</i> of the 31st Prussian Regiment, under
Major <span class="smcap">Natzmer</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thielemann</span> had now done all which could possibly have been
expected from any General under similar circumstances&mdash;with a force not
equal to one half of that of the Enemy, he had endeavoured, whenever
an opportunity offered, and in defiance of superior numbers, to force
back the French Left Wing upon the Dyle; but now that he had failed in
effecting this object, and that Bierge, the key of his position, had
been taken from him, whilst the French Left was pressing forward with
increased numbers to gain the Brussels road, he saw very plainly that
to attempt to maintain his ground any longer would be to expose himself
to the imminent risk of total overthrow, and that no other course was
left to him but to order a general retreat.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was about ten o'clock in the morning when the Prussian troops began
to retire from the Field. The Town of Wavre had not been attacked on
the 19th, and Colonel <span class="smcap">Zepelin</span> abandoned it without being
much pressed upon his line of retreat. Colonel <span class="smcap">Marwitz</span> was
ordered to form the Rear Guard, which was furnished from the 7th and
8th Uhlans, and the 3rd and 6th Kurmark Landwehr Cavalry. It was
accompanied by three Batteries of Horse, and one of Foot, Artillery.
With these troops Colonel <span class="smcap">Marwitz</span> took Post, at first, in
front of the Brussels road; placing three Batteries on his Left, and
the remaining one in Reserve. <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span> gave the Rear Guard
an express Order not to march off until Wavre had been completely
evacuated.</p>

<p>In the mean time, <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>'s <i>Corps d'Armée</i> had crossed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[Pg 621]</a></span>
the Dyle both at Bierge and at Wavre. The two Battalions of the 4th
Kurmark Landwehr, which had been posted in the hollow in rear of the
Town, for the protection of the twelve pounder Battery, became closely
pressed in consequence of this movement. One of the Battalions under
Major <span class="smcap">Schmade</span> had advanced against an Enemy's Column near the
Brussels road; when it unexpectedly received the fire of three French
Battalions, which were pushing forward under cover of an eminence, and
followed by some Cavalry. The Battalion succeeded in reaching the small
Wood near La Bavette; and as the Enemy attempted to turn the latter, it
suddenly attacked and drove him back, after which it came up with the
Rear Guard. The other Battalion, commanded by Major <span class="smcap">Schwerin</span>,
attacked a French Battalion which was advancing against it, threw it
back in confusion, and then continued its retreat. The gallantry and
steadiness displayed in this affair by the Kurmark Landwehr acquired
for the latter great and well merited renown.</p>

<p>The French Cavalry debouched from the Wood of Rixansart and drew up,
with its Left resting upon Chambre. <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span> now advanced the
Columns of his Corps towards the Heights of La Bavette, and pushed
forward some Cavalry along the high road. The latter, however, was
driven back by Colonel <span class="smcap">Marwitz</span>.</p>

<p>It has been explained that General <span class="smcap">Borcke</span>, instead of posting
his remaining six Battalions in rear of the position at Wavre, as
intended by <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>, proceeded on his march to Couture, by
St Lambert. This place he reached about nightfall, when he despatched
an Officer to <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> to report his arrival. The latter,
in reply, desired him to bivouac on the spot where he was, and to
await further Orders on the following morning. The Brigade was still
in its bivouac at seven o'clock the next morning, when Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[Pg 622]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Stengel</span> passed through St Lambert with his Detachment. The
latter informed General <span class="smcap">Borcke</span> that he had defended the Bridge
of Limale, and had been followed by the Enemy's troops.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Borcke</span>, on hearing this, immediately broke up his bivouac,
and decided upon securing the Wood which extends from St Rober as far
as Rixansart. He deployed two Battalions of the 8th Regiment along
the edge of the Wood, and held the remaining four Battalions of his
Brigade, then with him, in reserve. Perceiving French Cavalry, at the
time of their first attack, marching into the Wood of Rixansart for the
purpose of advancing through it upon Chambre; he opened a fire upon
them from his Battery, with the hope of checking their movement. The
only effect it produced was that of their detaching three Regiments
of Cavalry towards his Brigade. These, however, contented themselves
with watching his movements. It is curious that the Ninth Brigade,
as if bent upon continuing the blunder committed the previous day of
detaching itself from its Corps, should not have attempted, with its
six Battalions, to effect a more important diversion upon the Enemy's
extreme Left, from which it was not more than three thousand paces
distant. It was then eight o'clock, and the Battle was maintained until
about eleven; and yet General <span class="smcap">Borcke</span> allowed the three Cavalry
Regiments to move off and join the remainder of the French Cavalry,
towards ten o'clock, at Chambre, without even attempting to molest
their movement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thielemann</span> effected his retreat, in several Columns, by
Ottenburg and St Achtenrode; at which latter place (about half way to
Louvain) he took up a position. The French Cavalry followed as far as
the Brussels road, and the Infantry occupied the Heights of La Bavette.</p>

<p>Between Wavre and Louvain the country assumes a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[Pg 623]</a></span> character,
being covered with hedges, hollow ways, ditches, and gardens, and is
altogether much intersected. From Ottenburg as far as St Achtenrode,
there is almost one continued defile. In this, Cavalry cannot act with
advantage; and it was therefore fortunate for the Prussian Cavalry that
it was followed but slowly by the French.</p>

<p>The loss experienced by <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s <i>Corps d'Armée</i> in
this Battle of the 18th and 19th of June, amounted to 2,476 men. No
returns whatever of the losses sustained by <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s Army
are forthcoming, but they could not have been less than those of the
Prussians.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such was the Battle of Wavre; a Battle the result of which was of
no advantage to <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> on the 18th, and of positive
disadvantage to him on the 19th. On the former day it did not prevent
the march of the great mass of the Prussian Army towards the Field
of Waterloo; and, on the 19th, the continuance of the contest,
while <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> was in full flight, exposed this, the only
remaining intact, portion of the French Army, to the imminent risk
of being completely cut off from all retreat. Nor can this defeat of
<span class="smcap">Thielemann</span> be looked upon as having shed additional lustre
upon the French arms, when it is considered how long and successfully
the Prussians battled against them with less than half their strength.</p>

<p>The errors which led to the circumstance of the force under
<span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>&mdash;constituting, as <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> himself has
been pleased to term it, the Right Wing of the French Army&mdash;becoming
exclusively occupied in attacking a single Corps of the Prussian Army;
whilst the remaining three Corps of the latter were wending their
way unmolested towards the decisive Field of Battle, have already
been sufficiently discussed: and now that their result has been fully
exhibited,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[Pg 624]</a></span> it is scarcely necessary to draw attention to the proof
which the latter affords of the entire ignorance of each other's
proceedings which characterised the conduct of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> and
<span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>, great Generals as they were, in this memorable
Campaign. The former received intelligence, before he began the
Battle with <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, that the Right Wing was to follow
the Prussians to Wavre, and to act in such a manner as to prevent
these from detaching towards the Anglo-Allied Army; and therefore
felt satisfied that his general plan of operations was in successful
progress. But in less than two hours from the commencement of the
Battle, the fatal consequence of both Generals having unaccountably
neglected to maintain a vigilant reconnaissance and an uninterrupted
communication, was made manifest; and the first intimation
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> received of the advance of the Prussians towards La
Belle Alliance was the distant view which he himself had, from his own
Field, of <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Corps descending the Heights of St Lambert,
at about one o'clock.</p>

<p>The leading principle of the French Emperor's plan was to endeavour,
by all means in his power, to beat the Armies opposed to him <i>in
detail</i>. It was therefore incumbent on him, in order to insure the
success of that plan, to adopt such precautionary measures as should
procure for him the earliest and the clearest information concerning
the movements of his Enemies. If he found it necessary temporarily
to divide his force, and act upon two lines; those measures became
still more indispensable, and at the same time admitted the greater
facility of execution. Several reconnoitring parties, both upon the
Flanks of the Army and in front of the interval between the two lines
of operation, under the guidance of experienced, active and intelligent
Officers, would have obtained for both Generals that insight into the
movements and designs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[Pg 625]</a></span> their opponents which was so essential for
the attainment of their common object: whilst parties detached from
each Wing, for the sole purpose of maintaining a close and direct
communication between them, would have afforded the ready means of
regulating each other's proceedings according to the circumstances
under which they might have found themselves respectively placed.</p>

<p>That there should have been so total a disregard of any measure of
the kind appears almost incredible; yet such was the fact; and hence
it came to pass that the despatch sent to <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>, at one
o'clock, from the Heights in rear of La Belle Alliance did not reach
him until seven in the evening; at which time, as before explained, it
was too late to admit of the instructions it conveyed being fulfilled:
and hence, also, <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> was left battling with his entire
force&mdash;not less than a third of the whole French Army&mdash;against a single
incomplete Prussian Corps, under <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>, from daybreak
until about eleven o'clock in the forenoon of the 19th, when he was
first made acquainted with the fact that during the whole of that time
the Army under <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, having been most signally defeated
and completely scattered on the preceding evening, was flying across
the frontier in the wildest confusion.</p>

<p>On receiving this latter intelligence, <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s first
idea was to march against the rear of the main body of the Prussian
Army: but, calculating that his force was not adequate for such an
enterprise, that the victorious Allies might detach to intercept his
retreat, and that he should be closely followed by that portion of
the Prussians which he had just defeated; he decided on retiring upon
Namur, where he would regulate his further operations according to the
intelligence he might gain in that quarter concerning the real state of
affairs.</p>

<p class="drop">IT would be difficult to discover, in the whole history of the Wars
of modern times, an instance in which so fine, so splendid, an Army
as that of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, one composed almost exclusively of
veterans, all men of one nation, entirely devoted to their Chief, and
most enthusiastic in his cause, became so suddenly panic stricken, so
completely disorganised, and so thoroughly scattered, as was the French
Army when it lost the Battle of Waterloo. A defeated Army usually
covers its retreat by a Rear Guard, but here there was nothing of the
kind: and hence that Army cannot be said to have retreated; but truly
to have fled, from the Field of Battle. No attempt to rally was made on
the Belgian soil, and it was not until some of the scattered fragments
of the immense wreck had been borne across the French frontier that
their partial junction on different points indicated the revival of
at least some portion of that mighty mass of warriors; who, but three
days before, had marched across this same frontier in all the pride of
strength, and in all the assurance of victory.</p>

<p>The rearmost of the fugitives having reached the Sambre, at Charleroi,
Marchienne, and Châtelet, by daybreak of the 19th, indulged themselves
with the hope that they might then enjoy a short rest from the fatigues
which the relentless pursuit by the Prussians had entailed upon them
during the night; but their fancied security was quickly disturbed by
the appearance of a few Prussian Cavalry, judiciously thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[Pg 628]</a></span> forward
towards the Sambre from the Advanced Guard at Gosselies. They resumed
their flight, taking the direction of Beaumont and Philippeville.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It had been arranged by <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> and <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, on
the Field of Waterloo, that the Prussian Army, not having been so much
crippled and exhausted by the Battle, should undertake the further
pursuit, and proceed by Charleroi towards Avesnes and Laon; whilst
the Anglo-Allied Army, after remaining during the night on the Field,
should advance by Nivelles and Binche towards Peronne.</p>

<p>On the following morning, the pursuing Cavalry belonging to the First,
Fourth, and partly to the Second, Prussian <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, reached the
vicinity of Frasne and Mellet.</p>

<p>The Fourth Corps marched at daybreak from Genappe, where it collected
together the Brigades which had been so much broken up by the continued
pursuit. The 8th Prussian Hussars, under Major <span class="smcap">Colomb</span>,
were detached from this Corps towards Wavre, to observe Marshal
<span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>. They were supported by the 1st Pomeranian Landwehr
Cavalry; and, shortly afterwards, the 2nd Silesian Landwehr Cavalry,
under Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Schill</span>, also followed in the same
direction.</p>

<p>After some hours' rest, the Fourth <i>Corps d'Armée</i> marched to Fontaine
l'Evêque, where it bivouacked. It had received Orders to communicate
from this place with Mons. The Advanced Guard, under General
<span class="smcap">Sydow</span>, was pushed forward, as far as Lermes, on the road to
Thuin; it being intended that this Corps should proceed by the road to
Maubeuge, along the Sambre.</p>

<p>The First <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, which had from the beginning followed the
Fourth as a Reserve, now advanced in pursuit of the Enemy by the direct
road to Charleroi. The Light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[Pg 629]</a></span> Cavalry at the head of the Column reached
the passages of the Sambre at Châtelet, Charleroi, and Marchienne,
without meeting any sort of opposition or impediment; nor did it
perceive any thing of the Enemy on the other side of the river. The
Corps halted for the night at Charleroi: having its Advanced Guard
at Marchienne, and its Outposts occupying the line from Montigny by
Louveral as far as Châtelet. Detachments from the Reserve Cavalry
were sent in the direction of Fleurus, to secure the Corps from any
molestation on the part of <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>; of whose proceedings
nothing positive was then known at the Prussian Head Quarters.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was not until nearly five o'clock in the evening of the 19th,
that General <span class="smcap">Borcke</span>, whose Brigade, the Ninth, was
still in the vicinity of St Lambert, discovered the retreat of
<span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s troops. He immediately communicated the fact to
General <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>, who ordered him to cross the Dyle the
next day (the 20th) and march upon Namur. The French Rear Guard of
<span class="smcap">Gérard</span>'s <i>Corps d'Armée</i> continued to occupy Limale until
nightfall. <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span> remained posted, during the night of the
19th, at St Achtenrode; having his Advanced Guard at Ottenburg.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 18 th, Pirch received Orders to march from
the Field of Waterloo with his <i>Corps d'Armée</i> (the Second)
in the direction of Namur; for the purpose of turning Marshal
<span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s Left Flank and intercepting his retreat upon the
Sambre.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pirch</span> made this movement during the night, passing through
Maransart, where he was joined by his Seventh Brigade; and crossing
the Genappe rivulet at Bousseval, as also, subsequently, the Dyle, on
his way to Mellery: which place he reached at eleven o'clock in the
forenoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[Pg 630]</a></span> of the following day. His Corps was much divided on this
occasion. He had with him the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Infantry
Brigades, and twenty four Squadrons of Cavalry: but the Fifth Infantry
Brigade, and the remaining fourteen Squadrons, were with that portion
of the Prussian Army which was pursuing the Enemy along the high road
to Charleroi. The Corps being greatly fatigued by the night march and
its exertions on the previous day, <span class="smcap">Pirch</span> ordered the troops to
bivouac and to betake themselves to rest.</p>

<p>During this march, Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Sohr</span> had pushed on with
his Cavalry Brigade, as an Advanced Guard; and now he was required
to gain intelligence concerning the Enemy's movements, and to seek a
communication with <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>. He found the Defile of Mont St
Guibert strongly occupied by the Enemy, but could obtain no information
respecting <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s Corps.</p>

<p>When it is considered how very near to Mellery <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>'s
<i>Corps d'Armée</i> must have passed, in order to fall into the Namur road
at Sombref; it seems extraordinary that <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>, who reached
that place at eleven o'clock in the forenoon of the 19th,&mdash;the same
hour at which <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>, then beyond Wavre, received the first
intimation of the defeat of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>,&mdash;should have permitted
<span class="smcap">Gérard</span> to continue his retreat unmolested. His troops
required rest, it is true; but had he maintained a good look out in
the direction of Gembloux, he would, in all probability, after the
lapse of a few hours, have been enabled to fulfil his instructions so
far as to have completely intercepted the retreat of a considerable
portion of <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s Army. That part of the Enemy's force
which Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Sohr</span> observed at Mont St Guibert, was
probably the Advanced Guard only of <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>'s <i>Corps d'Armée</i>;
since its Rear Guard remained at the Bridge of Limale until nightfall.
Taking all the circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[Pg 631]</a></span> into consideration, more especially the
express object of the detached movement of the Second Prussian <i>Corps
d'Armée</i>, it must be admitted that, on this occasion, there was a want
of due vigilance on the part of General <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>.</p>

<p>It was on the 19th, also, that Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> issued, whilst
at Genappe, a Proclamation to his Army; in which he thanked the troops
for their conduct during the recent struggle.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At daybreak of the 19th, that portion of the Duke of
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Army which had fought the Battle of Waterloo,
broke up from its bivouac, and began to move along the high road
to Nivelles. Those troops which had been posted in front of Hal
during the 18th, consisting of <span class="smcap">Stedman</span>'s Dutch-Belgian
Division, <span class="smcap">Anthing</span>'s Dutch-Belgian Indian Brigade, and
Colonel <span class="smcap">Estorff</span>'s Hanoverian Cavalry Brigade, under Prince
<span class="smcap">Frederick</span> of the Netherlands; as also of <span class="smcap">Johnstone</span>'s
British Infantry Brigade, and <span class="smcap">Lyon</span>'s Hanoverian Infantry
Brigade, under Lieutenant General Sir <span class="smcap">Charles Colville</span>, were
likewise directed to march upon Nivelles. The Army occupied Nivelles
and the surrounding villages during the night of the 19th; in the
course of which the Duke arrived from Brussels, and established his
Head Quarters in the town.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An hour's rest was all that the harassing pursuit by the Prussians
permitted <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> to enjoy at Charleroi; and he was compelled
to fly across the Sambre, without the slightest chance of being enabled
to check that pursuit on the Belgian side of the frontier.</p>

<p>The following inscription, which has been cut over the centre of the
archway of the Charleroi gate, is singularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[Pg 632]</a></span> appropriate to the flight
of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> on this memorable occasion:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"ABIIT. EXCESSIT. EVASIT. ERVPIT."</p></blockquote>

<p>The circumstances, however, under which the flight of <span class="smcap">Cataline</span>
here described, and that of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, took place, form a
strange contrast. The former, subdued in the Senate by the indignant
philippics and burning eloquence of <span class="smcap">Cicero</span>, escaped from
Rome to the rebel camp of <span class="smcap">Manlius</span>, to take up arms against
his native city for the purpose of satisfying the cravings of his
profligate ambition; and the latter, defeated in the battle field, fled
to the capital, in the vain hope of obtaining from the Senate of his
country further means of waging war against the legitimate Sovereign.</p>

<p>From Charleroi, <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> proceeded to Philippeville; whence
he hoped to be able to communicate more readily with <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>.
He continued here four hours; which he employed in expediting Orders
to Generals <span class="smcap">Rapp</span>, <span class="smcap">Lecourbe</span>, and <span class="smcap">Lamarque</span>,
to advance with their respective <i>Corps d'Armée</i> by forced marches to
Paris: and also to the commandants of fortresses, to defend themselves
to the last extremity. He desired <span class="smcap">Soult</span> to collect together
all the troops that might arrive at this point, and conduct them to
Laon; for which place he himself started with post horses, at two
o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The general disposition of the respective Armies on the evening of the
19th, was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Anglo-Allied Army, which constituted the Right Wing of the
advancing forces, was at Nivelles and its vicinity.</p>

<p>The Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Head Quarters were at Nivelles.</p>

<p>Of the Prussian Army, which formed the Left Wing, its First <i>Corps
d'Armée</i> was at Charleroi;</p>

<p>Second Corps on the march to Mellery;</p>

<p>Third Corps at St Achtenrode;</p>

<p>Fourth Corps at Fontaine l'Evêque;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[Pg 633]</a></span></p>

<p>Fifth Brigade of the Second Corps at Anderlues, near Fontaine l'Evêque.</p>

<p>Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s Head Quarters were at Gosselies.</p>

<p>The disorganized force of the main French Army was in the vicinity of
Beaumont, Philippeville, and Avesnes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> was posting towards Laon.</p>

<p>The detached portion of the French Army under <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> was on
the march to Namur.</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, in whose character the highest
military talents of the Warrior were so intimately blended with
the most comprehensive views of the Statesman, did not allow the
dazzling allurements which beset the path of a Conqueror to divert
him for a single moment from that fixedness of purpose, or to dim
that penetrating foresight which so peculiarly distinguished his
proceedings on all great occasions of a similar nature, involving the
peace, the honour, and the security of not only his own Sovereign and
Country, but also of all the Allied Powers, in whose interests he was
so actively engaged. He did not view the great Battle he had gained
in the light of an event to be followed up by an irruption into the
Enemy's country, conducted in such a manner as to humble to the dust
the national pride of the French people; and to impose upon them the
whole weight and burthen of the oppressions, ravages, and horrors which
generally follow in the train of a victorious and lawless soldiery
over the face of an Enemy's country. His sole aim was directed to the
carrying out of the great object of the War, which comprised not only
the annihilation of the power of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> and of the adherents
to his cause, but also the Restoration of the legitimate Sovereign to
the Throne of France. With the latter Sovereign he had been in constant
communication, devising means for his protection during his temporary
exile in the Netherlands; and now that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[Pg 634]</a></span> the Armies were on the point
of crossing the frontier, counselling him to hasten forward and show
himself in the midst of his people: in order that by identifying his
cause with the common object of the Allied Powers he might avail
himself of all the influence and advantages to be derived from the
recent victory; and become, as it were, a participator in the brilliant
successes which attended their arms on the glorious 18th of June.</p>

<p>In proof of the sincerity of his intentions, and as a first step
towards securing the good will, if not the friendly disposition, of
the French people, more especially of the Legitimists and the well and
peaceably disposed; the Duke issued the following General Order to the
whole of the troops under his command:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-left: 55%;">

Nivelles, 20th June, 1815.<br />
</p>

<p><i>General Order.</i></p>

<p>1. As the Army is about to enter the French territory, the troops
of the Nations, which are at present under the command of Field
Marshal the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, are desired to recollect
that their respective Sovereigns are the Allies of His Majesty the
King of France; and that France ought, therefore, to be treated as
a friendly country. It is therefore required that nothing should be
taken, either by Officers or soldiers, for which payment be not made.
The Commissaries of the Army will provide for the wants of the troops
in the usual manner; and it is not permitted either to soldiers or
Officers to extort contributions. The Commissaries will be authorised
either by the Field Marshal, or by the Generals who command the troops
of the respective Nations, in cases where their provisions are not
supplied by an English Commissary, to make the proper requisitions,
for which regular receipts will be given; and it must be strictly
understood that they will themselves be held responsible for whatever
they obtain in way of requisition from the inhabitants of France,
in the same manner in which they would be esteemed accountable for
purchases made for their own Government in the several dominions to
which they belong.</p>

<p>2. The Field Marshal takes this opportunity of returning to the Army
his thanks for their conduct in the glorious action fought on the
18th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[Pg 635]</a></span> instant, and he will not fail to report his sense of their
conduct in the terms which it deserves to their several Sovereigns.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 55%;">
<span class="smcap">Wellington.</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>On the same day, the Duke, in consequence of a report received by him
from Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">Lecoq</span>, and of a previous communication
made to him by the King of <span class="smcap">Saxony</span>, consented to take command
of the Saxon <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, amounting to nearly 17,000 men. He
directed the above General to march these troops to Antwerp, and there
await further Orders.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Anglo-Allied Army marched this day to Binche and Mons. The British
Cavalry moved into villages between Roeulx and Mons. <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s
Hussar Brigade took the Outpost duties on the Sambre. The Hanoverian
Cavalry furnished Outposts towards Maubeuge. The Duke fixed his Head
Quarters at Binche.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, having secured the passage of the Sambre in the
neighbourhood of Charleroi, continued his pursuit of the Enemy, and
crossed the French frontier on the 20th. He directed <span class="smcap">Zieten</span> to
march the First <i>Corps d'Armée</i> from Charleroi to Beaumont, to throw
forward his Advanced Guard as far as Solre le Château, to detach a
Party of Observation to the left towards Florenne, and to watch the
road from Philippeville to Beaumont.</p>

<p>As the First <i>Corps d'Armée</i> advanced, it discovered at every step
fresh proofs of the extreme disorder in which the French Army had
retreated; and found twelve pieces of Artillery which they had hitherto
contrived to save from the great wreck at Waterloo, but had now
abandoned to their pursuers. On arriving at Beaumont, the Corps took up
a bivouac. Its Advanced Guard, under General <span class="smcap">Jagow</span>, consisting
of the Third Infantry Brigade, the 1st Silesian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[Pg 636]</a></span> Hussars, and a Horse
Battery, reached Solre le Château upon the road to Avesnes.</p>

<p>The Prince, at the same time, ordered <span class="smcap">Bülow</span> to move the
Fourth <i>Corps d'Armée</i> as far as Colleret, where the road to Thuin
intersects the high road from Beaumont to Maubeuge, and to push on
the Advanced Guard to Beaufort. <span class="smcap">Bülow</span> accordingly directed
General <span class="smcap">Sydow</span> to proceed with an Advanced Guard, consisting
of a Cavalry Brigade, a Horse Battery, and two Battalions of Infantry,
which had the day before reached Lermes on the road to Thuin, and
to ascertain very particularly whether the French had established
themselves on the Sambre, to secure the Bridges both here and at
Lobbes, and further, to restore these passages, should they have
been destroyed by the Enemy. Another Detachment, under Colonel
<span class="smcap">Eicke</span>, consisting of two Fusilier Battalions, the two
Squadrons attached to the Thirteenth Brigade, and of the 2nd Silesian
Hussars, was sent forward to take possession, in the first instance, of
the passages of the Sambre, and then to join General <span class="smcap">Sydow</span>;
who, proceeding by Colleret towards Beaufort, was to form both
Detachments into an Advanced Guard on reaching the latter place. In the
mean time, the mass of the Fourth Corps, headed by the Reserve Cavalry
under Prince <span class="smcap">William</span> of Prussia, followed in one Column.</p>

<p>The progress made by this portion of the Prussian Army on the 20th was
not so rapid as was desirable. Considerable delay arose in consequence
of the degree of caution imparted to the movements by the impression
which <span class="smcap">Bülow</span> entertained that the Enemy would defend the
passages, and endeavour to maintain himself along the opposite side of
the river. Hence the Advanced Guard of the Corps only reached Ferrière
la Petite; part of the main body proceeded as far as Montignies, and
the remainder with the Reserve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[Pg 637]</a></span> Artillery, did not get farther than the
Bridges across the Sambre.</p>

<p>The Fifth Brigade (belonging to the Second <i>Corps d'Armée</i>) had started
at daybreak from its bivouac at Anderlues, near Fontaine l'Evêque;
and directed its march, by Binche, upon Villers, towards Maubeuge.
The Brigade was reinforced by one hundred Dragoons under Major
<span class="smcap">Busch</span>, and half a Horse Battery; which Detachment arrived at
Villers at five o'clock in the afternoon. This Cavalry was employed in
observing the Fortress of Maubeuge, from the Mons road, as far as the
Sambre; and the Brigade bivouacked at Villers. A Hanoverian Regiment of
Hussars also observed the Fortress on the right of the Prussian Cavalry
upon the Bavay road.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Left Wing of the Prussian Army, comprising the Third, and part
of the Second, <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, came into collision with the Enemy
this day, when pursuing that part of the French Army which was under
<span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>. <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>, having learned that the latter
had commenced his retreat upon Gembloux, marched at five o'clock in the
morning from St Achtenrode to Wavre; where he further ascertained that
already on the afternoon of the 19th, the French had effected their
retreat across the Dyle, leaving only a Rear Guard on the left bank of
the river.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>, when he decided on retiring upon Namur, ordered
General <span class="smcap">Bonnemains</span> to move on rapidly, by Gembloux, with
the 4th and 12th Dragoons, as an Advanced Guard, and to reach that
town as soon as possible, and secure the passage of the Sambre. They
were followed by the remainder of <span class="smcap">Excelmans</span>' Cavalry, and
the Reserve Artillery, together with the wounded. The Infantry was
put in motion in two Columns: the one, consisting of the Third <i>Corps
d'Armée</i>, proceeding by Gembloux; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[Pg 638]</a></span> other, comprising the Fourth
Corps, passing more to the right, and falling into the Namur road in
rear of Sombref. The Light Cavalry was principally with the Rear Guard.
To deceive <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>, <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> left his Rear Guard
in Wavre and Limale, with Cavalry Picquets thrown out towards the
Prussians, until near evening; when it followed the main body to Namur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>, having placed the whole of his Cavalry, with eight
pieces of Horse Artillery, at the head of his Column, now ordered them
to move on at a trot, for the purpose of overtaking the Enemy; but it
was not until they had passed Gembloux that they discovered the Rear
of <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s force, consisting of a few Regiments of Cavalry.
These, however, now made so rapid a retreat, that it was impossible to
bring them to action.</p>

<p>At length, on arriving near the Village of Fallize, within about three
miles from Namur, the Prussians found <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>'s Rear Guard
posted on the brow of the declivity at the foot of which lay the town,
in the valley of the Meuse. It presented about two Battalions of
Infantry, three Regiments of Cavalry, and four guns; and was formed to
cover the retreat of the French troops.</p>

<p>The Prussian Battery immediately opened a fire; during which Colonel
<span class="smcap">Marwitz</span>, moving out to the right, with the First Cavalry
Brigade, and Count <span class="smcap">Lottum</span> to the left, with the Second,
turned the Enemy in both Flanks. The latter brought forward a Reserve
of Cavalry, when the 8th Prussian Uhlans, under Colonel Count
<span class="smcap">Dohna</span>, at the head of the Column that turned the Enemy's
Left, made a most gallant attack upon the French Dragoons; who met it
with a volley from their carbines, but were overthrown. The 7th Uhlans
and a Squadron of the 12th Hussars also charged on this occasion, and
captured three pieces of French Horse Artillery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[Pg 639]</a></span> which were in the
act of moving off, as also fifty Cavalry horses. The Enemy's Infantry
now threw itself into the adjacent Wood, with which the declivities
that here lead down into the valley of the Meuse are covered, and thus
succeeded in preventing the Prussians from following up their success.</p>

<p>At this moment, intelligence was received that General <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>
was pursuing the Enemy with the Second <i>Corps d'Armée</i> upon the high
road leading from Sombref to Namur; whereupon the Cavalry of the Third
Corps was moved into this direction. A French Column, consisting of
about twelve Battalions and two Batteries, but without any Cavalry, was
perceived marching along that road. They belonged to <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>'s
<i>Corps d'Armée</i>, which had effected its retreat by Limale, through
Mont St Guibert. Upon the Height on which the Château of Flavinnes
is situated was posted a Detachment from <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>'s Corps,
consisting of from four to five Battalions with a Battery, and a
Regiment of Cavalry, for the purpose of receiving <span class="smcap">Gérard</span>'s
Column as it fell back, and of protecting its retreat. As the Enemy
continued its retrograde march in Close Column and in good order; it
was not deemed advisable to undertake an attack with the two Prussian
Cavalry Brigades of the Third Corps, which were much fatigued: but the
Horse Battery was drawn up, and discharged several rounds of shell and
grape at the French troops during their retreat upon the town. The
latter, therefore, quitted the high road, and moved along the adjacent
Heights until they reached the Battalions which had been drawn up in
support, and which now opposed the further advance of <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s
<i>Corps d'Armée</i>.</p>

<p>At this time, <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s Cavalry withdrew, leaving the
further pursuit of the Enemy to the latter Corps&mdash;to the movements of
which it is now necessary to recur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[Pg 640]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not until five o'clock in the morning of the 20th that
<span class="smcap">Pirch</span> received intelligence that the Enemy was retiring by
Gembloux upon Namur. Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Sohr</span> was immediately
detached, in all haste, to Gembloux with his Cavalry Brigade, a Battery
of Horse Artillery, and the Fusilier Battalions of the 9th, 14th,
and 23rd Regiments, as an Advanced Guard. On approaching that town,
Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Sohr</span> ascertained that <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s
Cavalry was pursuing the Enemy along the high road from Gembloux to
Namur. He therefore decided upon marching by the narrow road on the
right of the <i>chaussée</i> leading from Sombref, in full trot, covered
by the Wood, to overtake the French troops in retreat. At Temploux,
the latter presented a force of two Battalions, some Cavalry, and four
pieces of Artillery in position, prepared to cover the retreating
Column. Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Sohr</span> immediately attacked with both
the Regiments of Hussars, supported by the Battery of Horse Artillery;
and defeated this portion of the Enemy's forces. It was at this moment,
too, that a cannonade was opened upon the latter by the Horse Battery,
before mentioned, of <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s Corps; whereupon it fell
back upon the favourable position taken up near Flavinnes, and in which
the Enemy appeared determined to make a stand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pirch</span> immediately ordered the attack, and directed that it
should be supported by Major General <span class="smcap">Krafft</span> with the Sixth
Brigade, which had closely followed the Advanced Guard, and had come
up with the latter at four o'clock in the afternoon. Three Columns of
Attack were formed. The First consisted of the 1st Battalion of the
9th Regiment, the Fusilier Battalion of the 26th Regiment, and the 1st
Battalion of the 1st Elbe Landwehr. It was under the command of Major
<span class="smcap">Schmidt</span>, and detached to the left of the road, to drive back
the Enemy's troops posted in the Wood and upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[Pg 641]</a></span> Heights. The Second
consisted of the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 26th Regiment, and the
2nd Battalion of the 9th Regiment, under Colonel <span class="smcap">Reuss</span>, and
of the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Elbe Landwehr, under Colonel
<span class="smcap">Bismark</span>. This Column, which advanced partly on the right, and
partly on the left, of the road, was supported by the Battery No 5,
and led by Major General <span class="smcap">Krafft</span> in person. The Third Column
comprised the Fusilier Battalions which had constituted the Infantry
of the Advanced Guard; and was detached more to the right, towards the
Sambre, to support the general advance upon Namur.</p>

<p>General <span class="smcap">Krafft</span>, after having kept up a fire, for a short
time, upon the Enemy with his Artillery, ordered the attack with his
Infantry. Colonel <span class="smcap">Reuss</span> threw out his Skirmishers, who were
quickly followed by the Columns of Attack. The Enemy, after some little
resistance, was fairly driven into Namur by a charge with bayonets, and
suffered much loss.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Major <span class="smcap">Schmidt</span>, with his Column of three
Battalions, had turned the Enemy's Right Flank on the Louvain road;
and the French were now limited to the defence of the suburb, which,
however, was maintained with great obstinacy. The Prussian Columns of
Attack, advancing at the <i>pas de charge</i>, drove the Enemy out of the
suburb, and endeavoured to gain possession of the Gates of the town.
Colonel <span class="smcap">Zastrow</span>, the second in command of the Sixth Brigade,
wished to burst open the Gate which leads to the Louvain road; but was
repulsed by a most murderous fire of musketry and grape, directed upon
the assailants from the walls of the town.</p>

<p>On repeating the attempt, the Prussian Battalions fought with
distinguished bravery, but with a great sacrifice of life. Colonel
<span class="smcap">Zastrow</span> was killed at their head; Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[Pg 642]</a></span> <span class="smcap">Bismark</span>
also fell; Colonel <span class="smcap">Reuss</span> was wounded; and the Sixth Brigade
alone lost forty four Officers, and 1,274 Under Officers and Privates.</p>

<p>The main body of <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s Army was at this time in full
retreat upon Dinant, along the Defile of the Meuse. The troops left in
Namur, to keep the Prussians at bay as long as possible, consisted of
General <span class="smcap">Teste</span>'s Division. They carefully barricaded all the
Gates, lined the walls facing the Prussians, and made a most gallant
resistance. The Officers, finding that their men continued so perfectly
steady as not to require their attention, armed themselves with the
muskets of the wounded, and assisted in maintaining the fire from the
walls. The greatest order prevailed in the Town. The wounded, the
provisions, and ammunition, had already been removed; and were on the
line of march.</p>

<p>General <span class="smcap">Pirch</span> was well aware that the French defended the town
solely for the purpose of covering their retreat, and had therefore
no intention of undertaking any serious attack; he simply wished to
possess himself of the suburbs, and to hold the Enemy in check by
detaching troops to the Porte de Fer and the St Nicholas Gate. He
thought that a demonstration against the latter Gate would raise
apprehensions in the minds of the French respecting the security of the
Bridge over the Sambre.</p>

<p>With this view, he ordered General <span class="smcap">Brause</span> to relieve, with
the Seventh Brigade, the troops then engaged; and together with the
Advanced Guard under Lieutenant Colonel Sohr, to blockade the Town. At
the same time he directed the remainder of the Corps to bivouac near
Temploux.</p>

<p>General <span class="smcap">Brause</span> proceeded to post the Fusilier Battalion
of the 22nd Regiment in the direction of the Porte de Fer, and the
Fusilier Battalion of the 2nd Elbe Landwehr towards the Brussels Gate.
The main body of the Seventh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[Pg 643]</a></span> Brigade, under Colonel <span class="smcap">Schon</span>,
was stationed in rear of the suburb. The first mentioned Battalion
stood, under cover, at four hundred paces distance from the Porte de
Fer, having its <i>Tirailleurs</i> in the Avenue near the Gate. Just as
General <span class="smcap">Brause</span> rode up to examine its formation, an alarm
was spread in front that the Enemy was making a sortie. The General
desired the Commanding Officer, Major <span class="smcap">Jochens</span>, to lead his
Battalion quickly against the defenders, to overthrow them, and then,
if possible, to penetrate into the town along with the retreating
troops. As Major <span class="smcap">Jochens</span> approached the Gate, he found in
its immediate vicinity the <i>Tirailleurs</i> of the Sixth Brigade, still
maintaining the contest in that quarter. The attacking Column and the
<i>Tirailleurs</i> now rushed towards the Gate and the walls; which the
French, probably not deeming themselves strong enough to resist this
pressure, abandoned in the greatest haste.</p>

<p>General <span class="smcap">Teste</span> had, in fact, prepared everything for his
retreat; and had so well calculated the time which the Enemy would
require in forcing an entrance by the Porte de Fer, that he succeeded
in filing his Battalions along the parapets of the Bridge, which had
been barricaded, and thus withdrew them to the south bank of the
Sambre. The Prussians found it impossible to force open the Gate. The
windows of the adjoining house of the <i>Douaniers</i> were therefore driven
in, and a small iron door which led from the interior of the house into
the town was opened, and, in this manner, an entrance was effected
for the assailants; who were conducted by Major <span class="smcap">Jochens</span>, of
the 22nd, and Major <span class="smcap">Luckowitz</span>, of the 9th Regiment, across
the Market Place, and as far as the Bridge over the Sambre: which the
French had barricaded, as before stated, and behind which they had
again established themselves. These troops were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[Pg 644]</a></span> closely followed by
Major <span class="smcap">Schmidt</span>, with the 9th Regiment, and lastly by the 2nd
Elbe Landwehr, in Close Column, under Majors <span class="smcap">Mirbach</span> and
<span class="smcap">Lindern</span>.</p>

<p>The Prussians immediately occupied the captured portion of the town;
posted a Column of Reserve on the Market Place, and with loud cheers,
made themselves masters of the Bridge over the Sambre. An attempt had
been made to gain the Enemy's rear, by means of a ford in this river;
but it proved unsuccessful.</p>

<p>The French were driven with so much impetuosity towards the Gate
leading out to Dinant, that there appeared every probability of a
considerable number of them falling into the hands of the Prussians.
The former, however, had heaped up large bundles of wood, intermingled
with straw and pitch, against the Gate, and set them on fire on the
approach of the Prussian troops. The Gate and the street were soon in
flames, and the pursuit was thus obstructed; but even had this not
occurred, the great fatigue of the troops who, during the previous
sixteen hours, had been either marching or fighting, was sufficient to
deprive them of the power of following the retreating Enemy with any
degree of vigour.</p>

<p>After nine o'clock in the evening, the town was in the possession of
the Prussians. Major <span class="smcap">Schmidt</span> took the command at the Dinant
Gate and Major <span class="smcap">Jochens</span> at the Bridge over the Sambre. The
remaining troops of the Seventh, and some Battalions of the Sixth,
Brigade were posted by General <span class="smcap">Brause</span> upon the Market Place.
The Fusilier Battalions of the Advanced Guard, which had supported the
attack, more to the right, had also advanced into the town, towards the
Bridge over the Sambre. They had been sharply cannonaded by the Enemy
from the right bank of the Sambre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[Pg 645]</a></span></p>

<p>A small party of Cavalry, under Captain <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>, of the
Pomeranian Hussars, was sent forward a short distance on the road to
Dinant, to form the Advance of the troops destined to pursue the Enemy
at daybreak.</p>

<p>General <span class="smcap">Teste</span>'s Division retired slowly, and in good order, by
the Dinant road, as far as Profondeville; where it took up a position
during three hours. At midnight it resumed its march, and arrived at
Dinant at four o'clock on the following morning.</p>

<p>This retreat of <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> by Namur upon Dinant was executed in a
skilful and masterly manner; and the gallant defence of the former town
by General <span class="smcap">Teste</span>'s Division, unaided by Artillery, merits the
highest commendation.</p>

<p>In this action the Prussians suffered a loss, including that already
mentioned as having occurred to the Sixth Brigade, of 1,500 men; and
the French are supposed to have lost about the same number. In the last
attack, the latter abandoned 150 prisoners they had previously taken
from the Prussians.</p>

<p>The Second Prussian <i>Corps d'Armée</i> occupied Namur during the night.
The Cavalry of the Third Corps bivouacked at Temploux; the Infantry
of the latter (which had been rejoined on the march from Wavre by the
Ninth Brigade), near the town of Gembloux.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The circumstances under which the French Army, generally, was placed on
the 19th of June rendered it sufficiently obvious that <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>
would be compelled to effect his retreat by Namur; and further, that
whatever show of resistance he might offer on that point would be
solely intended to gain time for the security of his troops whilst
retiring, in one Column only by the long and narrow Defile of the
Meuse which leads to Dinant. Aware<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[Pg 646]</a></span> that <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s defeated
Army was retiring along the direct line of operation, the Charleroi
road; he immediately saw the imminent risk of his own retreat becoming
intercepted, and the consequent necessity of his effecting the latter
in a parallel direction, with a view to his rejoining the main Army
as soon as practicable. To retire, therefore, by Gembloux upon Namur,
and thence along the line of the Meuse, by Dinant and Givet, naturally
presented itself as the true and proper course to be pursued.</p>

<p>To Generals in command of <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, such as <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>
and <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>, a little reflection upon <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s
critical position must have led to a similar conclusion. The inactivity
of the former, during the afternoon and evening of the 19th, is
probably to be explained by his having satisfied himself that the
longer <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> continued in the vicinity of Wavre, the greater
became the chance of his retreat being cut off by a portion of the
Allied Armies; which, in their advance, would reach the Sambre much
sooner than it would be in the power of the French Marshal to do: and
that, therefore, it would be injudicious on his part to attempt to
force the latter from the position, which appearances induced him to
believe he still occupied with his entire force, on the Dyle. He may
also have been strengthened in this opinion by the circumstance of
his not having received any positive instructions as to his future
dispositions, or any reinforcements to secure for him a preponderance
over <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>.</p>

<p>With <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>, however, the case was very different. He received
distinct Orders, on the evening of the 18th, to march at once from
the Field of Waterloo, and continue his movement during that night,
so as to cut off <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s retreat upon the Sambre. It has
already been explained, that on reaching Mellery, at eleven o'clock
on the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[Pg 647]</a></span> morning, he halted to give his troops rest; that he
subsequently ascertained, through Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Sohr</span>,
who had been despatched, during the march, with his Cavalry Brigade to
reconnoitre on the left, that the French occupied the Defile of Mont
St Guibert in force. This intelligence might have satisfied him that
<span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> had not yet reached Namur; but, if he entertained any
doubts on that point, these could easily have been settled by means of
a reconnoitring party, detached from Mellery, by Gentinne, and St Gery,
to Gembloux, a distance of seven miles. He would then have learned,
that no portion whatever of <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s force had hitherto
crossed this line, in retreat; that he had, consequently, gained
considerably on his rear, and had it in his power, after allowing a
few hours rest to his troops, to march them by the high road which
leads directly from Mellery into the high road near Sombref, and to
anticipate <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> in the possession of Namur.</p>

<p>In this case, <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>, on approaching the latter place, and
finding it occupied by <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>, would, in all probability, have
hesitated to risk the loss of so much time as an attempt to force the
town and the Pont de Sambre would necessarily incur, and have preferred
endeavouring to pass his troops across the Sambre by some of the
bridges and fords between Charleroi and Namur, and retire upon either
Philippeville or Dinant; but with a Prussian <i>Corps d'Armée</i> at each of
these points, and another in his rear, this would have been, to say the
least of it, a most hazardous undertaking; and if he attempted to cross
the Meuse below Namur, his chance of regaining <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s Army
would have been still more remote.</p>

<p>But setting aside the circumstance of <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>'s not having, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[Pg 648]</a></span>
this manner, taken due advantage of the position in which he stood
relatively with <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> during the 19th; and passing to the
fact, that he first learned, at five o'clock on the morning of the
20th, whilst still at Mellery, that the Enemy was retiring along the
high road from Gembloux to Namur, pursued by <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s
Cavalry: it seems strange that, inferring, as he must naturally have
done, that <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> would only endeavour to hold out long
enough at Namur to effect his passage by the Pont de Sambre, and to
cover his retreat to Dinant, he did not immediately move off by his
right, and push his troops across the Sambre by some of the bridges
and fords higher up the stream; and then, marching in the direction
of Profondeville, under cover of the Wood of Villers within the angle
formed by the confluence of the Sambre and the Meuse, intercept
<span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s retreat through the long and narrow Defile in which
the road to Dinant winds by the side of the last mentioned river.
The situation in which <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> would have been placed by
a movement of this kind&mdash;his troops in a long, narrow, precipitous
Defile, obstructed in front by <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>, and attacked in rear by
<span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>&mdash;would have been perilous in the extreme.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pirch</span> probably felt that his <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, part of which
was then attached to the Army pressing the Enemy by the Charleroi road,
was not equal to cope with <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s troops; but in the case
here supposed, by judiciously disposing his force then present so as
to command the Defile at some favourable point in its course, he would
have secured for himself an advantage which, under such circumstances,
would have fully compensated for his deficiency in regard to numbers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">[Pg 649]</a></span></p>

<p>The scattered remnants of the main French Army continued to be hurried
forward in wild confusion across the frontier. Some of the fugitives
hastened towards Avesnes, others to Philippeville: whilst a very great
proportion of them sought no temporary rest of this kind, but, throwing
away their arms, fled into the interior, to return to their homes; the
Cavalry, in many instances, disposing of their horses to the country
people. Several of the superior Officers hastily collected such of the
troops as appeared better disposed, and conducted them in the direction
of Laon. <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> reached the latter town in the afternoon
of the 20th. After conferring with the <i>Préfet</i>, he desired <span class="smcap">M.
de Bussy</span>, one of his Aides de Camp, to superintend the defence
of this important place; and despatched General <span class="smcap">Dejean</span> to
Avesnes, and General <span class="smcap">Flahaut</span> to Guise.</p>

<p>In the mean time, a body of troops had been discerned in the distance,
moving towards the town. <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> sent an Aide de Camp
to reconnoitre it; when it proved to be a Column of about three
thousand men, which <span class="smcap">Soult</span>, <span class="smcap">Jerome</span>, <span class="smcap">Morand</span>,
<span class="smcap">Colbert</span>, <span class="smcap">Petit</span>, and <span class="smcap">Pelet</span> had succeeded in
rallying and preserving in order. <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> now appeared intent
upon remaining at Laon until the remainder of the Army had reassembled:
but he subsequently yielded to the force of the arguments expressed in
opposition to this determination by the Duke of <span class="smcap">Bassano</span> and
others who were present, and took his departure for Paris; purposing,
at the same time, to return to Laon on the 25th or 26th of the month.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following was the general disposition of the respective Armies on
the evening of the 20th:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Anglo-Allied Army had its Right at Mons, and its Left at Binche.</p>

<p>The British Cavalry was cantoned in the villages of Strepy, Thieu,
Boussoit sur Haine, Ville sur Haine, and Coegnies; <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s
Brigade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[Pg 650]</a></span> in those of Merbes Ste. Marie, Bienne le Hapart, and Mons:
and the Hanoverian Cavalry in those of Givry and Croix. The Reserve
was at Soignies.</p>

<p>The Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Head Quarters were at Binche.</p>

<p>The Prussian Army had its First <i>Corps d'Armée</i> at Beaumont; Fourth
Corps at Collerets: Second Corps at Namur, with the exception of
the Fifth Brigade, which was on the march to blockade Maubeuge, and
bivouacked at Villers: Third Corps was at Gembloux, with its Cavalry
bivouacked at Temploux.</p>

<p>Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s Head Quarters were at Merbes le Château.</p>

<p>The French Army under <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> was completely dispersed. A
few of the troops took refuge in Avesnes, others in Guise, and the
principal body of them evincing any kind of order, but not exceeding
three thousand men, reached Laon.</p>

<p>The French forces under <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> were at Dinant.
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> quitted Laon for Paris.</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the 21st, the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> crossed the French
frontier, moving the principal portion of his Army to Bavay, and
the remainder from Mons upon Valenciennes, which Fortress was
immediately blockaded; and established his Head Quarters at Malplaquet,
celebrated as the scene of the glorious victory gained by the Duke
of <span class="smcap">Marlborough</span> and Prince <span class="smcap">Eugene</span> over the French
under Marshals <span class="smcap">Villars</span> and <span class="smcap">Boufflers</span> on the 11th of
September 1709.</p>

<p>Both the Allied Commanders had now reached the Triple Line of
Fortresses, which, until the Campaign of 1814 proved the contrary,
had been considered by so many military men as presenting an
insurmountable barrier to the advance of hostile armies into France
by its north-eastern frontier. It was most essential that some of
the principal Fortresses should be secured; and made to constitute a
new basis whence to direct the operations now contemplated against
the interior. The following, which first presented themselves on the
respective lines of advance of the two Commanders, were destined to
be immediately blockaded:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[Pg 651]</a></span>&mdash;Valenciennes, Lequesnoy, and Cambray, by
the Anglo-Allied Army; and Maubeuge, Landrecy, Avesnes, and Rocroi,
by the Prussians. The general arrangements for the besieging of the
Fortresses, and the planning of the further operations, above alluded
to, were to form the subject of a conference to be held very shortly
between the Chiefs.</p>

<p>Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> having, on this day, received reports from
<span class="smcap">Pirch</span> and <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>, detailing their proceedings
during the two previous days, and showing that <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> had
succeeded in effecting his escape by Dinant, immediately ordered that
the Second <i>Corps d'Armée</i> should move upon Thuin, and place itself
under the Orders of Prince <span class="smcap">Augustus</span> of Prussia; who was to
undertake the besieging of the Fortresses to be left in rear of the
Prussian Army; and that the Third Corps should march by Charleroi, and
follow the First and Fourth Corps as a Reserve.</p>

<p>It will be recollected that Captain <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span> was sent
forward from Namur, with a party of the Pomeranian Hussars, on the
night of the 20th, a short distance along the road to Dinant. He was
joined at daybreak of the 21st by Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Sohr</span>,
with the Fusilier Battalions of the 14th and 23rd Regiments, the
Brandenburg and Pomeranian Hussars, and five pieces of Horse Artillery;
when the whole force followed the Enemy towards Dinant. The latter
had, during his retreat, seized every favourable opportunity in narrow
and rocky parts of the Defile, to barricade the road, and offer every
obstruction to the pursuit: by means of which precaution, and the
previous night march, the French contrived to gain so considerably in
advance, that Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Sohr</span> deemed it prudent, when
near Dinant, to forego all further pursuit; and to endeavour to effect
a junction with the main body of the Prussian Army, by moving upon
Florennes and Walcour. At the former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">[Pg 652]</a></span> place he halted his Detachment
during the night of the 21st; and, in this manner, covered the Left
Flank of the main Army.</p>

<p>Anxious to gain intelligence concerning the assembling and marching
of the French troops on the left of the Allied Armies, Prince
<span class="smcap">Blücher</span> despatched Major <span class="smcap">Falkenhausen</span>, with the 3rd
Regiment of Silesian Landwehr Cavalry, to scour the country in the
vicinity of the road by Rettel to Laon. A Detachment of fifty Dragoons
was posted at Bossule le Valcourt, in observation of Philippeville.</p>

<p>The Fourth <i>Corps d'Armée</i> was ordered by the Prince to advance, this
day, as far as Maroilles, upon the road from Maubeuge to Landrecies.
Its Advanced Guard, under General <span class="smcap">Sydow</span>, was directed to
proceed still further, and to blockade the latter Fortress.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Zieten</span>, in pursuance of Orders which he had received the
night before, marched with the First <i>Corps d'Armée</i> upon Avesnes;
which Fortress, the Advanced Guard, under General <span class="smcap">Jagow</span>,
was directed to blockade on both sides of the Helpe. The march of
the Corps was made in two Columns: the Right, consisting of the
First and Second Brigades, proceeded by Semonsies, and halted at the
junction of the road from Maubeuge with that from Beaumont to Avesnes;
the Left, comprising the Fourth Brigade, the Reserve Cavalry, and
Reserve Artillery, marched by Solre le Château, towards Avesnes, and
bivouacked near the First and Second Brigades. Two Companies of the
Fourth Brigade, with twenty Dragoons, were left to garrison Beaumont;
but after the capture of Avesnes, they were ordered to move on to the
latter place.</p>

<p>It was between three and four o'clock when the Advanced Guard of the
Third Brigade, consisting of the 1st Silesian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[Pg 653]</a></span> Hussars, two Rifle
Companies, and a Fusilier Battalion, arrived in front of the Fortress
of Avesnes. The Commandant having rejected <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s summons
to surrender, the latter ordered the bombardment to be commenced
forthwith. Ten Howitzers, of which six were ten pounders and four seven
pounders, drew up on the Flank of the Cavalry, and fired upon the Town.
The houses of the latter being all strongly built, the shells failed
in setting any part on fire; and a twelve pounder Battery produced
no great effect upon the firm masonry of the works. At nightfall the
bombardment was suspended; with the intention, however, of resuming
it at midnight. When it ceased, a sortie was made by the French
<i>Tirailleurs</i>; but these were immediately encountered and gallantly
driven in by the Silesian Rifles, who lost ten men on this occasion.</p>

<p>Immediately after midnight, the Prussian Batteries recommenced their
fire. At the fourteenth round, a ten pounder shell struck the principal
Powder Magazine, when a tremendous explosion ensued, by which forty
houses were involved in one common ruin; but it occasioned no damage
whatever to the fortifications. The panic, however, which it created
amidst the garrison was such as to induce the latter to express its
desire to capitulate. Such a desire could only have proceeded from
the want of sufficient energy on the part of the Commandant, or from
a bad disposition evinced by the garrison; for when the Prussians
subsequently entered the place, they found in it 15,000 cartridges for
cannon, and a million musket ball cartridges. There were also in the
Fortress forty seven pieces of artillery, mostly of heavy calibre;
which were now made available in the besieging of the remaining
Fortresses. The garrison, comprising three Battalions of National
Guards, and two hundred Veterans, were made prisoners of war. The
National Guards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[Pg 654]</a></span> were disarmed, and sent off to their respective homes;
but the Veterans were conducted to Cologne.</p>

<p>The possession of Avesnes, gained too with so little sacrifice of life,
and with none of time, was of essential importance to the Prussians;
offering as it did a secure depôt for their material and supplies upon
their new line of operation. It also served for the reception of their
sick, and all who had been rendered incapable of keeping up with the
Army.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the 21st, the French Army continued collecting its scattered
remnants between Avesnes and Laon.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following was the general disposition of the respective Armies on
the evening of the 21st:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Anglo-Allied Army had its principal force at Bavay; and its Right
at Valenciennes, which it blockaded.</p>

<p>The Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Head Quarters were at Malplaquet.</p>

<p>The Prussian Army had its First <i>Corps d'Armée</i> near Avesnes.</p>

<p>The Fourth Corps at Maroilles; its Reserve Cavalry blockading Landrecy.</p>

<p>The Second Corps at Thuin, except the Fifth Brigade which blockaded
Maubeuge.</p>

<p>The Third Corps at Charleroi.</p>

<p>Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s Head Quarters were at Noyelles sur Sambre.</p>

<p>The defeated portion of the French Army lay between Avesnes and Laon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s force was at Philippeville.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, steadfastly pursuing that line of
policy which led him to constitute as an important feature of his plan,
the practical assurance to the French people, that, although entering
their country as a Conqueror, he did so in hostility to none, save
the Usurper and his adherents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[Pg 655]</a></span> issued the following Proclamation,

<p>No Proclamation of a similar nature was issued by Prince
<span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, nor were any direct Orders given by the latter
to remind his troops that France was "to be treated as a friendly
country," or to forbid them taking anything "for which payment be not
made."</p>

<p>Hence, in the advance to Paris, a marked contrast was observed between
the conduct of the Prussian, and that of the Anglo-Allied, Army: the
troops of the former committing great excesses and imposing severe
exactions along their whole line of march; whilst the British and
German troops under the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> acquired from the
outset the good will and kindly disposition of the inhabitants of the
country through which they passed. The Anglo-Allied troops inspired the
people with confidence: the Prussians awed them into subjection.</p>

<p>Much of the cause of all this may be traced to the different views
entertained by the two great Commanders. <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s extreme
hatred of the French would not allow him to modify, still less to
abandon, the opinion which he had imbibed from the first moment he
heard of the escape of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> from Elba; that they ought not
only to be thoroughly humbled, but also severely punished. Neither he
nor his soldiers could ever forget the monstrous cruelties and grinding
extortions which their own country had been compelled to endure when
overrun by the French: and now that they were once more brought into
the land of their bitterest Enemies, and another period of retribution
had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">[Pg 657]</a></span> arrived; but one sentiment pervaded the whole Prussian Army&mdash;that
those who had not scrupled to inflict the scourge of War throughout the
whole Continent, should, in their turn, be made duly sensible of its
evils. A contrary train of ideas, or a different course of proceeding,
on the part of the Prussians was scarcely to be expected. Hence the
value of the excellent and orderly conduct of the British troops
operating as a salutary counterpoise to the domineering and revengeful
spirit which actuated the Prussians.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blücher</span> felt equally with <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> that the
advance upon Paris before the approach of the Allied Armies, which
were then only crossing the Rhine, was a departure from strictly
military principles; and that this could only be justified by the
extraordinary moral effect which would be produced by the signal defeat
of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>. But his views were limited to the military
part of the plan, which was to make a dash at the capital; and, if
possible, to intercept <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> whilst endeavouring to rejoin
the routed force under <span class="smcap">Soult</span>. <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s admirable
policy embraced a wider field. He invariably kept in view the great
object for which the War had been undertaken. The information which he
contrived to obtain relative to the effect which <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s
disaster produced upon the minds of the leading men of the great
political Parties by which France was then agitated, and upon the
Members of the two Chambers of Parliament generally, combined with
the knowledge he had already acquired of the disposition of the
inhabitants of the Department of the North, which, in fact, had not
evinced that enthusiasm attendant upon the return of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>
from Elba that was manifested throughout the greater part of the
nation, convinced him that by adopting measures calculated to impress
upon the French people that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[Pg 658]</a></span> Allies were friendly towards them,
though inveterately hostile to <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, and by seizing
every advantage afforded by the presence and the influence of their
legitimate Monarch, he was, by such means, insuring the security
of the operations upon Paris more effectually than could have been
accomplished by additional military force applied under different
circumstances.</p>

<p>The aid which such a line of conduct, on the part of the Duke, gave
to the cause of <span class="smcap">Louis XVIII.</span> was immense. The people of the
Northern Departments, who, in general, were wearied by the continuance
of wars undertaken for the sole purpose of aggrandizing and upholding
the power of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>; and who now longed to enjoy the
blessings of peace, saw in the friendly disposition of the Allies, and
the support which these yielded to the King's authority, a pledge of
their determination to crush the War Party, and at the same time, to
cement their alliance with the legitimate Sovereign. The White Flag
was soon seen to wave from countless steeples. The tide of Royalty,
favoured in no small degree by the versatile nature of the French
character, was already setting in fast: and as it rolled steadily on
towards the capital, the Duke's customary foresight and good tact gave
it an impulse which not only bore him along with it in easy triumph;
but, when it subsequently reached the goal, swept away every vestige of
the Government usurped by <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> and his adherents.</p>

<p class="drop">ON the 22nd of June, the Second and Fourth British Divisions, as
also the Cavalry, of the Anglo-Allied Army marched to Le Cateau and
its vicinity. The First and Third British Divisions, the Divisions
of Dutch-Belgian Infantry attached to the First Corps, the Nassau
troops, and the Dutch-Belgian Cavalry were encamped near Gommignies.
The Fifth and Sixth British Divisions, the Brunswick Corps, and the
Reserve Artillery, were encamped about Bavay. The Advanced Guard
(<span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s Brigade) was at St Benin. Troops of the Corps under
Prince <span class="smcap">Frederick</span> of the Netherlands blockaded Valenciennes and
Le Quesnoy.</p>

<p>The Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Head Quarters were at Le Cateau.</p>

<p>Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> being desirous of bringing his different <i>Corps
d'Armée</i> into closer connection, moved the First and Fourth only half
a march this day. The former proceeded from Avesnes to Etroeungt,
sending forward its Advanced Guard to La Capelle, and Patrols as far
as the Oise: the latter marched along the road leading from Landrecy
towards Guise, as far as Fesmy; pushing forward its Advanced Guard to
Henappe, and Detachments to Guise. Scouring parties of Cavalry were
also detached from the First Corps in the direction of Rocroi.</p>

<p>The Third Prussian <i>Corps d'Armée</i> advanced from Charleroi to Beaumont;
detaching towards Philippeville and Chimay, for the security of its
Left Flank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[Pg 660]</a></span></p>

<p>The Second Prussian Corps, which was destined to operate against
the Fortresses, moved from Thuin. It was disposed in the following
manner:&mdash;The Fifth and Seventh Brigades, with the Cavalry, blockaded
Maubeuge; the Sixth Brigade was on the march to Landrecy; and the
Eighth Brigade was moving upon Philippeville and Givet.</p>

<p>Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s Head Quarters were at Catillon sur Sambre.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s troops, on this day, reached Rocroi.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The remains of the vanquished portion of the French Army continued
retiring upon Laon, and collecting in its vicinity. <span class="smcap">Soult</span> had
established the Head Quarters at this place. The men and horses of
the Artillery Train were moved on to La Fère, to be supplied with new
ordnance; and every means was adopted to replace this branch of the
service on an efficient footing. <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> was effecting his
retreat upon Soissons, by the line of Rocroi, Réthel, and Rheims; and
it was considered, that as soon as the latter should be able to unite
his force to the remains of the Army collecting under <span class="smcap">Soult</span>,
it would yet be found practicable, with the additional aid of Reserves,
to stem the advance of the Allies.</p>

<p>But where was the Chief whose presence had heretofore been the spell
by which a turbulent and restless soldiery was wont, when subdued by
the <i>fortune de la guerre</i>, to be restored to its former self, and
to be imbued with new life and renovated strength by the prospect of
acquiring fresh glory in retrieving a great national disaster? Had
he flown towards the nearest <i>Corps d'Armée</i> of <span class="smcap">Rapp</span> and
<span class="smcap">Lecourbe</span>, to lead them, along with all the Reserves that he
could possibly collect together, including the Regimental Depôts,
the <i>Gensd'armerie</i>, and even the <i>Douanerie</i>, against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[Pg 661]</a></span> the Flank of
the victorious Armies of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> and <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>,
during their hazardous advance upon the capital; and, in combination
with <span class="smcap">Soult</span> and <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>, to effect their separation,
perhaps their destruction?</p>

<p>No! The sword by which the Empire had been raised and held in
subjection, by which Europe itself had been enthralled and all but
conquered, had fallen powerless from his grasp. In him were no longer
centred the might and the will of Imperial France. These had been
delegated through the Constitution, to the organs of the nation, the
elected Representatives of the People. He no longer possessed, in
his own person, the Administrative and the Executive; but was under
the control of that power which, as before observed, when he quitted
Paris to join the Army, he dreaded more than the Enemy he was going to
confront&mdash;the power of Public Opinion legitimately expressed. If he
had so keenly felt its force before his downfall on the battle field;
how great, nay, how hopeless, must have appeared to him the task of
endeavouring to soothe its excitement, and to obtain its sanction to
renewed sacrifices, when suddenly appearing in Paris on the afternoon
of the 21st of June&mdash;but one short week from the time of his assuming
the command of his Army&mdash;himself to announce the disastrous result of
his enterprise.</p>

<p>The Imperialists in the capital, who had indulged in the most
extravagant hopes engendered by the news of the victory at Ligny,
had scarcely manifested their exultation when sinister rumours began
to spread of some sudden reverses which had befallen the cause of
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>; and presently all doubts and suspense were removed
by the unexpected appearance of the Emperor himself, which gave rise to
the most gloomy anticipations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> immediately summoned a Cabinet Council.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">[Pg 662]</a></span> He frankly
explained to his Ministers the critical state of affairs; but, at the
same time, with his usual confidence in his own resources, declared his
conviction, that if the nation were called upon to rise <i>en masse</i>,
the annihilation of the Enemy would follow; but that if, instead of
ordering new levies and adopting extraordinary measures, the Chambers
were to allow themselves to be drawn into debates, and to waste their
time in disputation, all would be lost. "Now that the Enemy is in
France," he added, "it is necessary that I should be invested with
extraordinary power, that of a temporary Dictatorship. As a measure
of safety for the country, I might assume this power; but it would be
better and more national that it should be conferred upon me by the
Chambers."</p>

<p>The Ministers were too well acquainted with the general views and
disposition of the Chamber of Representatives to pronounce a direct
approval of this step; but <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, perceiving their
hesitation, called upon them to express their opinion upon the measures
of public safety required by existing circumstances. <span class="smcap">Carnot</span>,
the Minister of the Interior, conceived it to be essential that the
country should be declared in danger; that the <i>Fédérés</i> and National
Guards should be called to arms; that Paris should be placed in a
stage of siege, and measures adopted for its defence; that at the last
extremity the armed force should retire behind the Loire, and take up
an intrenched position; that the Army of La Vendée, where the Civil War
had nearly terminated, as also the Corps of Observation in the south,
should be recalled: and the Enemy checked until sufficient force could
be united and organised for the assumption of a vigorous offensive,
by which he should be driven out of France. <span class="smcap">Decrès</span>, the
Minister of the Marine, and <span class="smcap">Regnault de Saint Jean d'Angely</span>,
the Secretary of State, supported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">[Pg 663]</a></span> this opinion; but <span class="smcap">Fouché</span>,
the Minister of Police, and the remaining Ministers, remarked that the
safety of the State did not depend upon any particular measure which
might thus be proposed, but upon the Chambers; and upon their uniting
with the Head of the Government: and that by manifesting towards them
confidence and good faith, they would be induced to declare it to be
their duty to unite with <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> in the adoption of energetic
measures for securing the honour and independence of the nation.</p>

<p>This advice on the part of <span class="smcap">Fouché</span> was an artful piece of
dissimulation. No man in France possessed so intimate a knowledge
of the secret workings of the public mind; he knew precisely the
dispositions and views of the different factions, as also the character
and temperament of their Leaders. He knew also that the great Parties
in the Chambers, with the exception of the Imperialists, who were in
the minority but whom he secretly flattered with the prospect of a
<span class="smcap">Napoleon II.</span>, were fully prepared to depose the Emperor, in
favour of full Constitutional Freedom and Liberal Institutions. This
knowledge, obtained with an adroitness and a precision quite peculiar
to this celebrated Minister of Police, he made completely subservient
to his own personal views. These had been, from the commencement of
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s second reign, to coquet with the factions in such a
manner as to induce each to consider him an indispensable instrument in
the realisation of its hopes; and to exert this extraordinary influence
either to support or to undermine the power of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>,
according as the fortunes of the latter might be in the ascendant or on
the decline. The resolute attitude assumed by the Allies soon satisfied
him that, although the Emperor might once more dazzle the world with
some brilliant feat of arms, he must eventually succumb to the fixed
determination of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">[Pg 664]</a></span> Sovereigns to crush his usurped authority; and to
the overwhelming masses with which Europe was preparing to subjugate
the country. He had been, and was still, in secret communication
with the Ministers and Advisers of <span class="smcap">Louis XVIII.</span>; and was
consequently in full possession of the general plans and intentions of
the Allies.</p>

<p>When, therefore, <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s enterprise had so signally failed,
and the reoccupation of Paris appeared to be its necessary consequence:
<span class="smcap">Fouché</span> foresaw clearly, that were the proposed Dictatorship to
be assumed by means of a sudden and forced dissolution of the Chambers,
implying that the recent reverses had been produced by treachery on
the part of the Representatives; and were new levies to be raised <i>en
masse</i>, in support of the force that yet remained available; the result
would inevitably be anarchy and confusion in the capital, disorder and
excesses throughout the whole country, renewed disasters to the nation,
together with an awful and useless sacrifice of life. To prevent
such a catastrophe, it was necessary to lull <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s
suspicions of the intentions of the Chambers; with which, at the
same time, <span class="smcap">Fouché</span> was fully acquainted. Hence it was, that
to gain sufficient time for the development of these intentions,
<span class="smcap">Fouché</span> gave to the Council the advice before mentioned.</p>

<p>He strongly expressed his disapproval of the projected Dissolution of
the Chambers, and assumption of the Dictatorship; declaring that any
measures of that kind would only tend to create distrust, and, not
improbably, a general revolt. But, at the same time, his agents were
making known throughout Paris the fullest extent of the disasters
that had befallen <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, and which had caused his sudden
and unexpected return; and the Deputies were assembling in all haste,
and in great numbers, to take a bold and decided step in this great
national crisis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">[Pg 665]</a></span></p>

<p>In thus dissembling from his Master the real disposition of the
great political Parties, and the true state of the public mind,
<span class="smcap">Fouché</span>, no doubt, betrayed the trust reposed in him; but,
setting aside the question whether he was really influenced by
patriotic motives, or merely acting upon a system of deep duplicity and
time serving expediency, there can also be no doubt that, by pursuing
the line of conduct which he did on this important occasion, he became
the means of preserving his country from the infliction of a still
further accumulation of evils.</p>

<p>The Cabinet Council continued in discussion; some supporting,
and others disapproving, the propositions of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>:
who, at length, yielding to the arguments of <span class="smcap">Fouché</span> and
<span class="smcap">Carnot</span>, declared he would submit himself to the loyalty of the
Chambers, and confer with them as to the measures which the critical
position of the country might render necessary.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the Deputies had met, and commenced their
deliberations on the existing state of affairs. <span class="smcap">M. de la
Fayette</span>, the acknowledged Leader of the Liberal Party, having
received intelligence of the subject of discussion in the Council,
and aware that not a moment was to be lost in averting the blow with
which their liberties were menaced, ascended the tribune, and thus
addressed the Chamber, amidst the most profound silence, and breathless
suspense:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Representatives! For the first time during many years you hear a
voice, which the old Friends of Liberty will yet recognise. I rise to
address you concerning the dangers to which the country is exposed.
The sinister reports, which have been circulated during the last two
days, are unhappily confirmed. This is the moment to rally round the
National Colours&mdash;the Tricoloured Standard of 1789&mdash;the Standard of
Liberty, Equality, and Public Order. It is you alone who can now
protect the country from foreign attacks and internal dissensions.
It is you alone who can secure the independence and the honour of
France.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">[Pg 666]</a></span> Permit a veteran in the sacred cause of liberty, in all times
a stranger to the spirit of faction, to submit to you some resolutions
which appear to him to be demanded by a sense of the public danger,
and by the love of our country. They are such as, I feel persuaded,
you will see the necessity of adopting:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I. The Chamber of Deputies declares that the independence of the
Nation is menaced.</p>

<p>"II. The Chamber declares its sittings permanent. Any attempt to
dissolve it, shall be considered high treason. Whosoever shall render
himself culpable of such an attempt shall be considered a traitor to
his country, and immediately treated as such.</p>

<p>"III. The Army of the Line, and the National Guards, who have fought,
and still fight, for the liberty, the independence, and the territory
of France, have merited well of the country.</p>

<p>"IV. The Minister of the Interior is invited to assemble the principal
Officers of the Parisian National Guard, in order to consult on the
means of providing it with arms, and of completing this Corps of
Citizens; whose tried patriotism and zeal offer a sure guarantee for
the liberty, prosperity, and tranquillity of the capital, and for the
inviolability of the national Representatives.</p>

<p>"V. The Ministers of War, of Foreign Affairs, of Police, and of the
Interior are invited to repair immediately to the sittings of the
Chamber."</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No one ventured to oppose these bold Resolutions; and, after a brief
discussion, in which their instant adoption was urged in the strongest
manner, they were carried by acclamation, with the exception of the
Fourth, which was suspended on account of the invidious distinction
which it appeared to convey between the troops of the Line and the
National Guards.</p>

<p>They were then transmitted to the Chamber of Peers; where, after a
short discussion, they were adopted without amendment.</p>

<p>The Message from the Chambers, conveying these resolutions, reached
the Council in the midst of its deliberations. <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> was
staggered by an act which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">[Pg 667]</a></span> looked upon as an usurpation of the
Sovereign Authority. To him, who had so long exercised an almost
unlimited control in the State, who had led mighty Armies to victory,
and who had subjected powerful nations to his despotic sway, this
sudden and energetic voice of the people, conveyed through the medium
of their Representatives, aroused him to a full sense of the wonderful
change which had been effected in the public mind, and in his own
individual position, through the intervention of a Constitution. He was
alike indignant at what he conceived to be a daring presumption, and
mortified at his own miscalculation in having convoked the Chambers.
<i>J'avais bien pensé</i>, he remarked, <i>que j'aurais dû congédier ces
gens-là avant mon départ</i>.</p>

<p>After some reflection, he determined, if possible, to temporize with
the Chambers. He sent <span class="smcap">Regnault de Saint Jean d'Angely</span> to
the Chamber of Deputies, in his capacity of Member, to soothe the
irritation that prevailed, to relate that the Army had been upon the
point of gaining a great victory, when disaffected individuals created
a panic; that the troops had since rallied; and that the Emperor had
hastened to Paris to concert, with the Ministers and the Chambers,
such measures for the public safety as circumstances seemed to
require. <span class="smcap">Carnot</span> was directed to make a similar communication
to the Chamber of Peers. <span class="smcap">Regnault</span> vainly endeavoured to
fulfil his mission: the Deputies had lost all patience, and insisted
upon the Ministers presenting themselves at the bar of the House.
The latter at length obeyed the summons; <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> having
consented, though with great reluctance, to their compliance with the
mandate. He required them, however, to be accompanied by his brother
<span class="smcap">Lucien</span>, as an Extraordinary Commissioner, appointed to reply
to the Interrogatories of the Chamber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">[Pg 668]</a></span></p>

<p>At six o'clock in the evening, <span class="smcap">Lucien Buonaparte</span> and
the Ministers made their appearance in the Chamber of Deputies.
<span class="smcap">Lucien</span> announced that he had been sent there by
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> as a Commissioner Extraordinary, to concert with
the Assembly measures of safety. He then placed in the hands of the
President the Message of which he was the bearer from his brother. It
contained a succinct recital of the disasters experienced at Mont St
Jean: and recommended the Representatives to unite with the Head of the
State in preserving the country from the fate of Poland, and from the
reimposition of the yoke which it had thrown off. It stated, also, that
it was desirable that the two Chambers should appoint a Commission of
five Members, to concert with the Ministers the measures to be adopted
for the public safety, and the means of treating for peace with the
Allied Powers.</p>

<p>This Message was far from being favourably received. A stormy
discussion ensued, in the course of which it was soon made
manifest that the Deputies required a more explicit declaration
of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s opinions and designs: one, in fact, more
in accordance with the views which the majority of them evidently
entertained, and was apparently determined to enforce. One of
their number significantly remarked, as he addressed himself to
the Ministers, "You know as well as we do, that it is against
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> alone that Europe has declared War. From this moment,
separate the cause of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> from that of the Nation. In
my opinion, there exists but one individual who stands in the way
between us and peace. Let him pronounce the word and the country will
be saved!" Several of the Members spoke in a similar strain, and
the debate was kept up with great animation, until at length it was
agreed, that in conformity with the terms of the Imperial Message,
a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">[Pg 669]</a></span> Commission of five Members should be appointed, consisting of the
President and Vice Presidents of the Chamber, to collect, in concert
with the Cabinet and with a Committee from the House of Peers, the
fullest information upon the state of France, and to propose suitable
measures of safety.</p>

<p>The Committee consisted of Messrs <span class="smcap">Lanjuinais</span>, <span class="smcap">La
Fayette</span>, <span class="smcap">Dupont de l'Eure</span>, <span class="smcap">Flangergues</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Grenier</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucien</span> now presented himself, in the same capacity of
Commissioner Extraordinary, to the Chamber of Peers. After hearing
the Message, the latter also appointed a Committee, which consisted
of Generals <span class="smcap">Drouot</span>, <span class="smcap">Dejean</span>, <span class="smcap">Andreossy</span>, and
Messrs <span class="smcap">Boissy d'Anglas</span> and <span class="smcap">Thibaudeau</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, being fully informed of the proceedings of the
Chamber of Deputies, and of the general tenor of the debates, hesitated
a long time whether to dissolve the Assembly or to abdicate the
Imperial Crown. Some of his Ministers, on perceiving the direction of
his views, assured him that the Chamber had acquired too firm a hold
of the public opinion to submit to any violent <i>coup d'état</i>; and
expressed their opinion, that by withholding the act of abdication, he
might eventually deprive himself of the power of vacating the Throne in
favour of his son. Nevertheless he appeared determined to defer this
step to the very last moment; trusting in the mean time some favourable
event might occur, tending to modify the present disposition of the
Chamber.</p>

<p>The Deputies again met, at an early hour on the following morning. The
utmost impatience was manifested for the Report of the Committee. Two
hours having elapsed, the Members became greatly excited. Some of them
proposed that the exigencies of the State were such, that it was their
duty to adopt immediate and decisive measures, without waiting for the
Report.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">[Pg 670]</a></span></p>

<p>At length, in the midst of the agitation and tumult which prevailed,
General <span class="smcap">Grenier</span>, the Reporter of the Committee, suddenly made
his appearance. He stated that, after a deliberation of five hours, the
Committee had resolved:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"That the safety of the country required that the Emperor should
consent to the nomination, by the two Chambers, of a Commission,
charged to negotiate directly with the coalesced Powers; stipulating
only that they should respect the national independence, the
territorial integrity, and the right which belongs to every people of
adopting such Constitutions as it may think proper; and that these
negotiations should be supported by the prompt development of the
national force."</p></blockquote>

<p>This statement excited general murmurs of disapprobation. But the
Reporter, aware of the expectations of the Chamber, proceeded:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This Article, gentlemen, appears to me insufficient. It does not
fulfil the object which the Chamber proposes to itself, because it
is possible that your Deputation may not be admitted. I would not,
therefore, urge the adoption of this measure, had I not reason to
believe that you will soon receive a Message in which the Emperor will
declare his wish; that the effect of this should first be tried; and
that, should he then prove an insuperable obstacle to the nation being
permitted to treat for its independence, he will be ready to make
whatever sacrifice may be demanded of him."</p></blockquote>

<p>This produced an extraordinary sensation in the Assembly. It was looked
upon as an artful design upon the part of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> to create
delay by proposing to the Chambers a proceeding which he was well aware
would prove unsuccessful; and to seize the first favourable opportunity
of destroying their independence, and re-establishing his despotism&mdash;to
re-enact, in short, the Eighteenth of Brumaire. The tumult had reached
a fearful height. Many Members exclaimed vehemently against the Report.</p>

<p>At length, one of them, <span class="smcap">M. Duchesne</span>, ascended the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">[Pg 671]</a></span> tribune,
and spoke in the following energetic and decided manner:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I do not believe that the project proposed by the Committee is
capable of attaining the desired end. The greatness of our disasters
cannot be denied: they are sufficiently proved by the presence of the
Chief of our Armies in the capital. If there are no bounds to the
energies of the nation, there are limits to its means. The Chambers
cannot offer negotiations to the Allied Powers. The documents which
have been communicated to us demonstrate that they have uniformly
refused all the overtures which have been made to them; and they have
declared that they will not treat with the French, as long as they
shall have the Emperor at their head."</p></blockquote>

<p>The speaker was here interrupted by the President, who announced that
the Message to which the Reporter had referred would speedily be
received. The interruption, however, at this most important point of
the debate, renewed the tumult in the Chamber. Some exclaimed, "It is a
concerted plan to make us lose time." Others cried out, "Some plot is
concerting;" and the majority vociferated, "Proceed, proceed; there is
no middle course."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchesne</span> continued:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is necessary that we should be certain of finding in the
development of the national force, a defence sufficient to support our
negotiations, and to enable us to treat with success concerning our
honour and independence. Can that force be developed with sufficient
rapidity? May not circumstances again lead victorious Armies to the
capital? Then, and under their auspices, will reappear the ancient
Family." ("Never! never!" exclaimed several voices.) "I freely express
my opinion. What may be the consequences of these events? We have only
<i>one</i> certain means left, which is, to engage the Emperor, in the name
of the safety of the State, in the sacred name of a suffering country,
to declare his <i>Abdication</i>."</p></blockquote>

<p>No sooner was this word pronounced than the entire Assembly rose; and
amidst the clamour that ensued were heard a hundred voices exclaiming,
"Seconded! seconded!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[Pg 672]</a></span></p>

<p>When, at length, the President succeeded in restoring some degree of
order, he said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I cannot hope to arrive at any result, unless the agitation of the
Assembly be repressed. The safety of the country depends on the
decision of this day. I entreat the Chamber to wait for the Emperor's
Message."</p></blockquote>

<p>The proposition of <span class="smcap">Duchesne</span> was instantly supported by General
<span class="smcap">Solignac</span>: an Officer who, during the last five years, had been
made to suffer the severest mortifications, arising from the hatred
entertained towards him by <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, in consequence of his
refusal to be the servile instrument of his ambition; and, therefore,
the curiosity of the Chamber was naturally excited to hear what course
he was about to adopt.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And I also," said the General; "I share in the uneasiness of him who
has preceded me at this tribune. Yes! we ought to consider the safety
of the Empire, and the maintenance of our Liberal Institutions; and,
while the Government is inclined to present to you such measures as
tend to this end, it appears important to preserve to the Chamber the
honour of not having proposed an object which ought to be the free
concession of the Monarch. I move that a Deputation of five Members
shall be appointed to proceed to the Emperor, which Deputation shall
express to His Majesty the urgency of his decision. Their Report will,
I trust, satisfy at once the wish of the Assembly, and that of the
Nation."</p></blockquote>

<p>This proposition was most favourably received, and the President was
on the point of putting it to the vote, when <span class="smcap">Solignac</span> again
appeared in the tribune.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I wish," said he, "to propose an Amendment to my Motion. Several
persons have intimated to me that we shall soon be informed of His
Majesty's determination. I consequently think it necessary that we
should wait for <i>one hour</i>, to receive the Message; which it seems is
to be addressed to the Chambers. I therefore move that we adjourn for
that time." (This part of his speech was met with great disapprobation
on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">[Pg 673]</a></span> the part of the Chamber.) "Gentlemen!" continued the General, "we
all wish to save our country; but can we not reconcile this unanimous
sentiment with the laudable desire that the Chamber should preserve
the honour of the Chief of the State?" (Cries of "Yes! yes!") "If I
requested that we should wait until this evening or tomorrow, some
considerations might be opposed&mdash;but, one hour"&mdash;("Yes! yes! To the
vote!" was the general exclamation; and the Chamber adjourned).</p></blockquote>

<p>In the mean time, <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> had been made acquainted with the
disposition of the Chamber of Representatives, by <span class="smcap">Regnault de
Saint Jean d'Angely</span>; who hastened to warn him that if he did not
immediately abdicate, his deposition would, in all probability, be
declared.</p>

<p>He was enraged at the idea of this contemplated violence. "Since that
is the case," he said, "I will not abdicate at all. The Chamber is
composed of a set of Jacobins, impracticables, and intriguers; who are
seeking for disorder, or for place. I ought to have denounced them to
the Nation, and given them their dismissal. The time that has been lost
may yet be recovered."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Regnault</span>, however, urged him in the strongest manner to
yield to imperious circumstances, and to renew the noble and generous
sacrifice he made in 1814. He assured him that if he did not take
this step, he would be accused by the Chamber, and even by the whole
Nation, of having, out of personal considerations alone, prevented the
possibility of obtaining peace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Solignac</span> and other Deputies were then announced. They boldly
declared to him that he had no other course open to him but that of
submission to the desire entertained by the Representatives of the
Nation. <span class="smcap">Solignac</span> described to him the scene in the Chamber
of Deputies, and the difficulty he had experienced in inducing the
latter to suspend, even for one hour, their decision; which, if
not anticipated by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">[Pg 674]</a></span> voluntary Abdication, would entail upon him
the disgrace of forfeiture. Even his brothers, <span class="smcap">Lucien</span> and
<span class="smcap">Joseph</span>, now gave their opinion that the moment for resistance
had passed.</p>

<p>When the paroxysm of rage, to which these representations gave rise,
had subsided: <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> announced his determination to abdicate
in favour of his son; and, desiring his brother <span class="smcap">Lucien</span> to take
a pen, he dictated to him the following Declaration:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Frenchmen! In commencing the War for maintaining the national
independence, I relied on the union of all efforts, of all desires,
and the concurrence of all the national authorities. I had reason to
hope for success, and I braved all the Declarations of the Powers
allied against me.</p>

<p>"Circumstances appear to be changed. I offer myself a sacrifice to
the hatred of the Enemies of France. May they prove sincere in their
Declarations, and have really directed them solely against my power.
My political life is terminated; and I proclaim my Son, under the
title of <span class="smcap">Napoleon II.</span>, Emperor of the French.</p>

<p>"The present Ministers will form provisionally the Council of the
Government. The interest which I take in my Son induces me to invite
the Chamber to form the Regency by a law without delay.</p>

<p>"Unite all for the public safety, in order to remain an independent
Nation.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30%;">
"<span class="smcap">Napoleon.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>This was the last great act of his political life. Defeated and humbled
by foreign Enemies, subdued and controlled by the Representatives of
the Nation; he was forced to descend from a Throne whence he had at
one time swayed the destinies of Sovereigns rendered dependent on
his mighty will. Almost all the previous changes and gradations in
his extraordinary career had been preluded or accompanied by some
magnificent scene of dramatic effect, or a violent <i>coup d'état</i>; but,
in this instance, the transition was attended by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">[Pg 675]</a></span> no circumstance more
remarkable than the quietude with which it was effected. The cessation
of the political existence of such a man would have been most naturally
looked for as an event coincident only with the termination of a life
which, if not closed upon the pinnacle of glory, would be sought for
amidst the shock of battle, or in the vortex of a state convulsion.</p>

<p>That he meditated a second 18th of Brumaire, there can be no doubt;
but the decided tone of the debates in the National Assembly, the
solicitations of his friends, and the hope of securing the Throne to
his family, induced him to abandon all idea of such a project. It is,
besides, more than probable that, aware as he was of the bad feeling
that existed, to a great extent, both in the Chambers and in the
country, towards the <span class="smcap">Bourbons</span>; as also of the conflicting
principles of the different factions, he calculated upon the chances of
a Revolution productive of anarchy and confusion, which he yet might be
called upon to reduce to order and submission.</p>

<p>When it is considered that the great mass of the Army of the Line
was devoted to <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>; that the rallied Army of the North
was falling back upon Paris, where it would concentrate its strength
and be reinforced from Regimental Depôts; and, further, that the
Armies on the Eastern Frontier were still holding their respective
positions, and that even in La Vendée the Imperial troops had succeeded
in quelling the insurrection,&mdash;when, in addition to all this, it is
considered how great, how extraordinary, was the influence induced by
the <i>prestige</i> of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> with the majority of the nation,
dazzled as the latter had been by countless victories that outweighed,
in its estimation, those fatal disasters which it ascribed solely to
the united power of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">[Pg 676]</a></span> European League established against
France,&mdash;it is impossible not to be struck by the firm, bold, and
determined attitude assumed by the French Parliament. France, on this
critical occasion, displayed one of the brightest examples the World
has yet beheld of the force of Constitutional Legislation. Under all
the attendant circumstances, it was a remarkable triumph of free
institutions over monarchical despotism.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is now necessary to revert to the operations of the Allied Armies.</p>

<p>On the 23d of June, <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> and <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> gave
to the great mass of their troops a halt; not merely for the sake
of affording them rest, but also for the purpose of collecting the
stragglers, and bringing up the ammunition and the baggage.</p>

<p>The only movement made on the part of the Anglo-Allied Army, on this
day, was that by Major General <span class="smcap">Lyon</span>'s Sixth Hanoverian
Brigade, which, together with <span class="smcap">Grant</span>'s Hussar Brigade,
Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Webber Smith</span>'s Horse Battery, Major
<span class="smcap">Unett</span>'s and Major <span class="smcap">Brome</span>'s Foot Batteries, marched,
under the personal command of Sir <span class="smcap">Charles Colville</span>, to attack
Cambray, the garrison of which, the Duke had been led to believe,
had abandoned the place, leaving in it at most three hundred or four
hundred men. <span class="smcap">Colville</span> was furnished with a letter from the
Duke to the Governor, summoning him to surrender; as also with some
copies of his Grace's Proclamation of the 22nd to the French. The 1st
Brunswick Light Battalion was sent forward from the Reserve at Bavay,
to watch Le Quesnoy; which Fortress was still occupied by the Enemy.</p>

<p>The Third Prussian <i>Corps d'Armée</i> was pushed forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">[Pg 677]</a></span> to Avesnes, by
which means the Three Corps destined to advance upon Paris were so
placed that they could form a junction, with only half an ordinary
march; and this relative position was maintained throughout the
remainder of the line of advance.</p>

<p>The Allied Commanders had an interview on this day at Catillon, for
the purpose of arranging their plan of combined operations. The
intelligence they had procured having satisfied them that the Enemy
was collecting his forces at Laon and Soissons: they decided upon not
pursuing him along that line, since their progress towards the capital
might, in that case, be impeded by affairs of Advanced and Rear Guards;
but upon moving by the right bank of the Oise, and crossing this river
at either Compiegne or Pont St Maxence. By thus turning the French
Left, they hoped to intercept the Enemy's retreat, or at all events
to reach Paris before him; and in order to deceive him as to these
intentions, he was to be followed by Prussian Cavalry, assuming to be
the Advanced Guard of the Allied Armies.</p>

<p>It was also settled, that as they might find it necessary to throw
bridges across the Oise, the British General should bring forward his
Pontoon Train; that possessed by the Prussians being inadequate for the
purpose.</p>

<p>In order to secure a good base whence to conduct these operations, it
was further arranged that the Corps under Prince <span class="smcap">Frederick</span>
of the Netherlands should remain, for the purpose of besieging the
Fortresses situated on the Scheldt, and between that river and the
Sambre: and that the following Corps should undertake the besieging
of the Fortresses on the Sambre, and between this last river and
the Moselle, namely, the Second Prussian <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, commanded
by General <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>; the <i>Corps d'Armée</i> of North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">[Pg 678]</a></span> Germany,
commanded at first by General Count <span class="smcap">Kleist von Nollendorf</span>, and
subsequently by Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">Hacke</span>; as also a portion
of the garrison troops of Luxemburg, commanded by Lieutenant General
Prince <span class="smcap">Louis</span> of Hesse Homburg,&mdash;the whole of these German
forces being placed under the chief command of Prince <span class="smcap">Augustus</span>
of Prussia.</p>

<p>This plan of operations was such as might have been expected from
the combined councils of such Leaders as <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> and
<span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, and was undoubtedly the one best calculated to attain
the object they had in view; and it was carried into effect with
all that mutual cordiality and good fellowship which had invariably
characterised their proceedings.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 24th, the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, in
consequence of a report which he had received from Sir <span class="smcap">Charles
Colville</span>, directed Lord <span class="smcap">Hill</span> to march the two Brigades
of the Fourth Division then at Le Cateau, towards Cambray, where they
would join the other Brigade of the Division; and also to send with
them a nine pounder Battery.</p>

<p>On the arrival of these troops, <span class="smcap">Colville</span> made his preparations
for the attack; which took place in the evening, in the following
manner. Three Columns of Attack were formed. One commanded by
Lieutenant Colonel Sir <span class="smcap">Neil Campbell</span> (Major in the 54th
Regiment) escaladed at the angle formed by the Valenciennes Gateway and
the Curtain of the body of the place. A Second, commanded by Colonel
Sir <span class="smcap">William Douglas</span>, of the 91st Regiment, and directed by
Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Gilbert</span> of the Royal Engineers, escaladed at a
large Ravelin near the Amiens road. A Third, consisting of Colonel
<span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>'s Brigade, and directed by Captain <span class="smcap">Thompson</span>
of the Royal Engineers, after having forced the Outer Gate of the
Couvre Port in the Hornwork, and passed both ditches, by means of the
rails of the drawbridges,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">[Pg 679]</a></span> attempted to force the main Paris Gate; but
not succeeding in this, it escaladed by a breach on that side, which
was in a state of reparation. The three Batteries of Lieutenant Colonel
<span class="smcap">Webber Smith</span>, and Majors <span class="smcap">Unett</span> and <span class="smcap">Brome</span>,
under the direction of Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Hawker</span>, rendered
the most essential service in covering these attacks; which having
succeeded, the town speedily fell into the hands of the assailants. The
Citadel continued to hold out, but the Governor solicited a suspension
of hostilities; which, however, could not be granted.</p>

<p>Of the Anglo-Allied Army, the First and Third British Divisions,
the Dutch-Belgian Infantry attached to the First Corps, and the
Dutch-Belgian Cavalry, were moved this day from Gommignies, to Forest,
upon the road to Le Cateau, and then encamped between the villages of
Croix and Bousies.</p>

<p>The Second British Division continued at Le Cateau.</p>

<p>The Duke made no movement in advance; having found it necessary to
afford additional time for the coming up of the Pontoons and supplies.</p>

<p>The Reserve, consisting of the Fifth and Sixth Divisions, of the
Brunswick Corps, and the Reserve Artillery, was moved nearer to the
main body; and cantoned and encamped in and about the villages of Engle
Fontaine, Rancour, and Préau au Bois.</p>

<p>On this day Proposals were made to the Advanced Posts of this Corps
under Prince <span class="smcap">Frederick</span> of the Netherlands near Valenciennes,
as also to those of the First Prussian <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, for a
Suspension of Hostilities, upon the grounds that <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>
had abdicated in favour of his son; that a Provisional Government had
been appointed, consisting of <span class="smcap">Fouché</span>, <span class="smcap">Caulincourt</span>,
<span class="smcap">Grenier</span>, and <span class="smcap">Quinette</span>; and that these persons had
sent Ministers to the Allied Powers to treat for peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">[Pg 680]</a></span></p>

<p>Both <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> and <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> considered that they
would not be acting in accordance with the spirit and intentions of
the Alliance of the Powers of Europe were they to listen to such
proposals, and therefore peremptorily refused to discontinue their
operations. Those which were addressed to the Prussian Commander
emanated from General Count <span class="smcap">Morand</span>, who commanded the Rear
Guard of the French Army at Laon; and to whom <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> replied,
that no Armistice could be entered into, except in the case of
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> being delivered up, and the Fortresses in rear of the
Armies being abandoned and conceded as guarantees for its fulfilment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louis XVIII.</span>, acting on the advice so urgently tendered to him
by the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, arrived at Le Cateau late in the
evening, followed by a numerous train; and only awaited the surrender
of the Citadel of Cambray to fix his temporary residence in the latter
town.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Prussian Army renewed its operations on the 24th, according to the
plan agreed upon the day before by the Allied Commanders. At break of
day, Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Schmiedeberg</span> was despatched with the
Silesian Regiment of Uhlans, and some Horse Artillery, towards Laon;
for the purpose, in conjunction with the Detachments already sent
from the First <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, of watching and deceiving the Enemy.
<span class="smcap">Blücher</span> disposed his three <i>Corps d'Armée</i> in two Columns. The
Left Column, which was the one nearest to the Enemy, consisted of the
First and Third Corps; and was to move close along the Oise&mdash;the Third
Corps remaining half a march in rear of the First. The Right Column,
formed by the Fourth <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, was to advance along a parallel
road, keeping on a line with the former, and at the distance of about
half a march. The Left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">[Pg 681]</a></span> Column moved upon Compiegne, the Right upon
Pont St Maxence.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock, the First <i>Corps d'Armée</i> (<span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s)
commenced its march from Etroeungt towards Guise. The Advanced Guard,
under Major General <span class="smcap">Jagow</span>, to which were attached the 8th Foot
Battery, and two ten pounder howitzers, halted when opposite to St
Laurent, a suburb of Guise, in order to observe the Fortress on this
side; whilst <span class="smcap">Zieten</span> sent an Infantry Brigade, a Regiment of
Cavalry, together with a Horse, and a Foot, Battery, by St Germain and
La Bussière, across the Oise, to menace the place from the other side.</p>

<p>The Enemy, on finding himself completely invested, withdrew his troops
into the Citadel; whereupon preparations were immediately made by the
Prussians to open their Batteries against that part: but previously
to giving the Order to commence the cannonade, <span class="smcap">Zieten</span> sent a
summons to the Commandant to surrender; with which the latter did not
hesitate to comply. The garrison, consisting of eighteen Officers and
three hundred and fifty men, laid down their arms on the glacis, and
were made prisoners of war. The Prussians found in the place, fourteen
pieces of cannon, three thousand muskets, two million musket ball
cartridges, a quantity of ammunition, and considerable magazines; and
gained, what was of more importance, another strong point in their new
base of operations, without having fired a single cannon shot.</p>

<p>Major <span class="smcap">Müller</span>, with the two weak Fusilier Battalions of the
28th Regiment, and of the 2nd Westphalian Landwehr, remained to
garrison the place.</p>

<p>As soon as the remainder of <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Corps arrived near Guise,
which was before the place surrendered; the Advanced Guard, consisting
of the Third Brigade, moved on, but did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">[Pg 682]</a></span> not reach Origny before nine
o'clock in the evening. The 1st Regiment of Silesian Hussars pushed on
as far as Ribemont. Parties were also detached from the Reserve Cavalry
towards Crecy, Pont à Bussy, and La Fère, to observe the Serre.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>, with the Third <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, moved from Avesnes
upon Nouvion; which he reached about four o'clock in the afternoon.
The Detachments of Observation which had been previously sent out to
the left from this Corps, to endeavour to gain intelligence concerning
<span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s Army, reached Hirson and Vervin in the evening.
Scouring parties were also sent towards the road leading from Mézières
by Montcornet towards Laon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bülow</span>, with the Fourth <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, which formed the Right
Prussian Column, marched from Ferny to Aisonville and Bernonville.
Parties of Cavalry, detached from the Corps, reached Chatillon sur
Oise, and found St Quentin unoccupied. This circumstance having been
made known to General <span class="smcap">Sydow</span>, upon his arrival at Fontaine
Notre Dame with the Advanced Guard, he pushed on, and took possession
of that important town. A Detachment of from five hundred to six
hundred French Cavalry had marched from this place on the previous day
towards Laon. The troops which had been employed in the investment of
Landrecies rejoined the Fourth Corps on this day.</p>

<p>By means of these movements, and of the halt of the Duke of
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span> at Le Cateau, the Prussians were a day's march in
advance of the Anglo-Allied Army.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s troops this day reached Réthel.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The positions of the respective Armies on the evening of the 24th were
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">[Pg 683]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The First, Second, and Third Divisions of the Anglo-Allied Army were
in and around Le Cateau Cambresis: the Fourth Division at Cambray; the
Fifth and Sixth Divisions, the Brunswick Corps, and Reserve Artillery,
at, and in the vicinity of, Engle Fontaine.</p>

<p>The Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Head Quarters were at Le Cateau
Cambresis.</p>

<p>The First Prussian <i>Corps d'Armée</i> was at Guise, the Third at Muvion,
and the Fourth at Aisonville and Bernonville.</p>

<p>Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s Head Quarters were at Henappe.</p>

<p>The French troops under <span class="smcap">Soult</span> were at Laon; those under
<span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> at Réthel.</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the 24th, the Provisional Government in Paris, which had
been appointed on the previous day after a stormy discussion in
both Chambers on the subject of the recognition of <span class="smcap">Napoleon
II.</span>, and which consisted of the Duke of <span class="smcap">Otranto</span>
(<span class="smcap">Fouché</span>), Minister of the Police; the Duke of <span class="smcap">Vicenza</span>
(<span class="smcap">Caulincourt</span>), Minister of Foreign Affairs; <span class="smcap">Carnot</span>,
Minister of the Interior; General <span class="smcap">Grenier</span>; and <span class="smcap">M.
Quinette</span>; issued the following Proclamation:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Frenchmen!</p>

<p>"Within the period of a few days, brilliant successes and dreadful
reverses have marked your destinies.</p>

<p>"A great sacrifice appeared necessary to your peace and that of the
World; and <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> abdicated the Imperial Throne. His
Abdication forms the termination of his political life. His Son is
proclaimed.</p>

<p>"Your new Constitution, which possesses as yet only good principles,
is about to undergo its application; and even those principles are to
be purified and extended.</p>

<p>"There no longer exist Powers jealous of one another. The space is
free to the enlightened patriotism of your Representatives; and the
Peers feel, think, and vote, as they are directed by the public
opinion.</p>

<p>"After twenty five years of political tempests, the moment has arrived
when every thing wise and sublime that has been conceived respecting
social institutions may be perfected in yours. Let reason and genius
speak, and from whatever side their voices may proceed, they shall be
heard.</p>

<p>"Plenipotentiaries have been despatched, in order to treat in the
name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">[Pg 684]</a></span> of the Nation, and to negotiate with the Powers of Europe
that Peace which they have promised on one condition, which is now
fulfilled.</p>

<p>"The whole World will, like you, be attentive to their reply. Their
answer will make known whether justice and promises are accounted
anything on earth.</p>

<p>"Frenchmen! be united! Let all rally under circumstances of such vast
importance. Let civil discords be appeased. Let dissensions be silent
at this period, in which the great interests of nations are to be
discussed. From the Northern frontier to the Pyrenees, and from La
Vendée to Marseilles, let all France be united.</p>

<p>"Who is the man, that, born on the soil of France, whatever may be his
Party or political opinions, will not range himself under the National
Standard, to defend the independence of the country.</p>

<p>"Armies may in part be destroyed; but the experience of all Ages and
of all nations proves that a brave people, combating for justice and
liberty, cannot be vanquished.</p>

<p>"The Emperor, in abdicating, has offered himself a sacrifice. The
Members of the Government devote themselves to the due execution
of the authority with which they have been invested by your
Representatives.</p>

<p>"June 24th, 1815."</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the 25th, <span class="smcap">Louis XVIII.</span>, at the suggestion of the
Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, despatched an Officer, Le Comte
<span class="smcap">d'Audenarde</span>, with a summons, in His Majesty's name, for the
Governor, Baron <span class="smcap">Roos</span>, to surrender the Citadel of Cambray.
The summons was obeyed, and the garrison capitulated; when the Duke
immediately gave over the Fortress entirely to His Majesty.</p>

<p>The main body of the Anglo-Allied Army advanced this day to Joncour.
The Fourth Division continued at Cambray. The Reserve moved on to
Marets.</p>

<p>The First Prussian <i>Corps d'Armée</i> marched this day from Guise to
Cérisy, on the road from St Quentin to La Fère: its Advanced Guard
pushed on to Fargnières, near the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">[Pg 685]</a></span> place. An Officer and thirty
Dragoons were detached across the Oise to cut off the communication
between this Fortress and Laon, by which means the investment of the
place was effected. Along the right bank of the Oise, La Fère was
protected by inundations, and no favourable points presented themselves
for the establishment of Batteries. On this account, preparations were
made in the night to cross the river below the place, and gain the
Heights which command the Fortress on the Laon side.</p>

<p>During the march of the Advanced Guard, Major General <span class="smcap">Jagow</span>,
who commanded it, sent a Detachment of the 1st Silesian Hussars to
Chauny, which communicated by its left, through St Gobain, with Captain
<span class="smcap">Goschitzky</span> in Crespy, and by its left, with the Outpost at
Jussy of the Advanced Guard of the Fourth Corps. The parties detached
on the previous day to Crecy, Pont à Bussy, and along the Serre, were
now called in.</p>

<p>The Third Prussian <i>Corps d'Armée</i> marched from Nouvion to Homblières
and its vicinity. Two of its Brigades occupied passages across the
Oise, namely, the Ninth at Origny, and the Twelfth at Neuvillette.
The Eleventh Brigade bivouacked at Marey, and the Tenth at Homblières
and Menil St Laurent. The Detachments sent out from this Corps on the
previous day towards the road leading from Mezières to Laon, brought
in word that at eleven o'clock in the forenoon of the 24th, the French
troops had abandoned Aubenton, and marched off to Monternet; also that
<span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s Army had reached Rocroi on the 23rd, and Réthel
on the 24th; and it was presumed that his next march was to be on
Soissons. On the receipt of this intelligence these Detachments were
drawn back, and their observation limited to the ground nearest to the
left bank of the Oise.</p>

<p>The Advanced Guard of the Fourth Prussian <i>Corps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">[Pg 686]</a></span> d'Armée</i> was closely
followed by the Reserve Cavalry, and all these troops were placed
under the command of Prince <span class="smcap">William</span> of Prussia. The Cavalry
marched along the road leading to Chauny, as far as Montescour, where
it bivouacked. The main body of the Corps reached Essigny le Grand.</p>

<p>At St Quentin, Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> received a letter from Laon
addressed to the Allied Commanders by the Commissioners sent from the
two Chambers of the French Parliament; in which they communicated the
fact of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s abdication, and of the elevation of his Son
to the Throne, and stated that they had been deputed by the Provisional
Government to negotiate an Armistice.</p>

<p>To this the Prince replied verbally, by an Aide de Camp, that he would
suspend hostilities on arriving at Paris, provided <span class="smcap">Buonaparte</span>
was given up to him, and several Fortresses on the frontiers
delivered up as sureties; and provided, also, that the Duke of
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span> should agree to what might be proposed.</p>

<p>According to the accounts which were this day received from Lieutenant
Colonel <span class="smcap">Schmiedeberg</span> it was presumed that the Enemy was still
at Laon. The reports from the Detachments of the Third <i>Corps d'Armée</i>
also confirmed this view, and intimated that <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s troops
were yet two marches distant from Laon. This intelligence, combined
with the attempts made by the French to induce the Allies to enter
into negotiations, clearly showed the importance of endeavouring, by
means of a forced march, to gain the passages of the Oise, and then to
intercept the Enemy's line of retreat by Soissons upon Paris.</p>

<p>In the night of the 25th, however, decided information was received
that the French Army had marched from Laon to Soissons, a fact from
which it was naturally concluded that the Enemy was no longer deceived
as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">[Pg 687]</a></span> the advance of the Prussians towards Laon; and that he was
therefore bent upon effecting his further retreat, or, perhaps, even of
anticipating their movements towards the Oise, and detaching towards
Compiegne. Hence, not a moment was now to be lost in securing the
points of passage, particularly that at Compiegne; to which Prince
<span class="smcap">Blücher</span> attached so much more importance from the circumstance
that his Army had no Pontoons; and that the British Pontoon Train was
still far behind, and not to be calculated upon. The Prince decided
upon moving his Left Column (the First and Third Corps) on Compiegne,
and his Right Column (the Fourth Corps) upon Pont St Maxence; the
latter to secure the passage both at this place, and at Creil lower
down the Oise.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Soult</span>, who had been indefatigable in collecting at Laon the
remains of the defeated portion of the French Army, marched the latter,
on the 25th, to Soissons; where it was to be joined by the force under
<span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>: who, having preceded his troops which were yet a
march and a half distant, had arrived in that town, to take the command
of the whole Army, according to instructions conveyed to him from the
Provisional Government.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Soult</span>, as soon as he found himself thus superseded in the
command, quitted the Army, and repaired to Paris; disgusted with the
abrupt and uncourteous manner in which he had been treated.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The position of the respective Armies, on the evening of the 25th, were
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Of the Anglo-Allied Army, the Advanced Guard (<span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s
Brigade) was at Crisour, near St Quentin.</p>

<p>The Second Division, the Nassau troops, and the British Cavalry, were
encamped in the vicinity of Joncour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">[Pg 688]</a></span></p>

<p>The First and Third Divisions, the Dutch-Belgian Infantry attached to
the First Corps, and the Dutch-Belgian Cavalry, were encamped near
Serain and Premont.</p>

<p>The Fourth Division, with <span class="smcap">Grant</span>'s Light Cavalry Brigade, was
at Cambray.</p>

<p>The Fifth and Sixth Divisions, the Brunswick Infantry and Cavalry,
and the Reserve Artillery, were encamped at, and in the vicinity of,
Marets.</p>

<p>The Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Head Quarters were at Joncour.</p>

<p>The First Prussian <i>Corps d'Armée</i> was at Cérisy; the Third at
Homblières; and the Fourth at Essigny le Grand.</p>

<p>Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s Head Quarters were at St Quentin.</p>

<p>The Right Wing of the French Army, led by <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>, was at
Rheims; the Left, with <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>, at Soissons.</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the 25th, <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> withdrew from the capital to the country
Palace of Malmaison, whence he issued the following Address to the
Army:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Soldiers</span>!</p>

<p>"While obeying the necessity which removes me from the French Army; I
carry with me the happy assurance that it will justify, by the eminent
services which the country expects from it, the praises which our
Enemies themselves have not been able to refuse it.</p>

<p>"Soldiers! I shall follow your steps, though absent. I know all
the Corps; and not one of them will obtain a single advantage over
the Enemy, but I shall give it credit for the courage it may have
displayed. Both you and I have been calumniated. Men, very unfit to
appreciate your labours, have seen in the marks of attachment which
you have given me, a zeal of which I was the sole object. Let your
future successes convince them that it was the Country above all
things, which you served in obeying me; and that if I had any share
in your affection, I owe it to my ardent love for France&mdash;our common
mother.</p>

<p>"Soldiers! Some efforts more, and the Coalition will be dissolved.
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> will recognise you by the blows which you are about
to strike. Save the honour, the independence, of France! Be, unto the
last, the same men which I have known you for these twenty years; and
you will be invincible.</p>

<p class="drop">ON the 26th, the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> marched the main body of
his Army to Vermand and its vicinity.</p>

<p>Major General Sir <span class="smcap">John Byng</span>, who was now in command of the
First Corps, having heard, on passing that village, that the Duke
himself was there, immediately waited upon his Grace for any Orders he
might wish to give him.</p>

<p>The Duke, on seeing him, said, "You are the very person I wish to
see&mdash;I want you to take Peronne. You may as well take with you a
Brigade of Guards, and a Dutch-Belgian Brigade. I shall be there almost
as soon as yourself."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Byng</span> having given the necessary Orders for <span class="smcap">Maitland</span>'s
Brigade, and a Dutch-Belgian Brigade of <span class="smcap">Chassé</span>'s Division
attached to his Corps, to proceed on this duty; the former was
immediately put in motion.</p>

<p>The Duke, on reaching Peronne just as these troops arrived there,
summoned the garrison, and then proceeded, in person, to reconnoitre
that Fortress: and perceiving the possibility of taking it by storm,
gave Orders to prepare for an assault. His Grace then directed the
attack to be made upon the Hornwork which covers the suburb on the left
of the Somme. Lieutenant Colonel Lord <span class="smcap">Saltoun</span> immediately
led on the Light Troops of <span class="smcap">Maitland</span>'s Brigade, stormed, and
carried the outwork, with but little loss; on observing which, the
Duke, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">[Pg 690]</a></span> satisfied the place would prove an easy capture, returned
to Vermand.</p>

<p>Some pieces of Dutch artillery were now brought into the Hornwork, and
a cannonade was opened upon the town; but the fire kept up on both
sides was trifling, and of short duration: for <span class="smcap">Byng</span> having
sent forward his Acting Assistant Quartermaster General, Lieutenant
Colonel the Hon. J. <span class="smcap">Stanhope</span>, with a white flag, the Civil
Authorities interfered, and urged the garrison to capitulate; whereupon
the Maiden Fortress of Peronne surrendered on the condition that its
defenders should lay down their arms, and be allowed to repair to their
homes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Byng</span>, on returning to Vermand, to report the capture of the
Fortress to the Duke, met the Dutch-Belgian Brigade, which had been
ordered to move to Peronne at the same time as the Guards, about half
way towards that place!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colville's</span> Division rejoined the main body of the Army from
Cambray; which place was handed over to the troops of the King of
<span class="smcap">France</span>, under the Duke of <span class="smcap">Berry</span>.</p>

<p>The Reserve moved on to Bellicourt and Belle Englise.</p>

<p>Upon returning in the night to his Head Quarters at Vermand, the Duke
of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> found a note from Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>,
forwarding to him the letter from the French Commissioners before
referred to, and to which his Grace immediately replied as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-left:45%;">

"Head Quarters, 26th June 1815.&mdash;10 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"As Field Marshal the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> has only at this
moment returned to his Quarters, he has only now received from Marshal
Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> the letter of their Excellencies, and which
their Excellencies had sent to the Prussian Outposts.</p>

<p>"When the Field Marshal last heard from the Head Quarters of the
Allied Sovereigns, the 21st instant, their Majesties were at
Heidelberg, and they must still be in that direction. It must be
obvious to their Excellencies that the Field Marshal can neither
prevent nor aid their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691">[Pg 691]</a></span> Excellencies in reaching their Majesties; but
if he has it in his power, or if their Excellencies think proper to
pass through the countries in which the troops are under his command,
the Field Marshal begs they will let him know in what manner he can
facilitate their journey.</p>

<p>"The Field Marshal was not aware that any Officer commanding an
Advanced Post had agreed verbally, or in any other manner, to a
Suspension of Hostilities.</p>

<p>"Since the 15th instant, when <span class="smcap">Napoleon Buonaparte</span>, at the
head of the French Armies, invaded the dominions of the King of the
Netherlands, and attacked the Prussian Army; the Field Marshal has
considered his Sovereign, and those Powers whose Armies he commands,
in a state of war with the Government of France; and he does not
consider the Abdication of <span class="smcap">Napoleon Buonaparte</span> of his usurped
authority, under all the circumstances which have preceded and
attended that measure, as the attainment of the object held out in the
Declarations and Treaties of the Allies, which should induce them to
lay down their arms.</p>

<p>"The Field Marshal cannot consent therefore to any Suspension of
Hostilities, however desirous he is of preventing the further effusion
of blood.</p>

<p>"As the only object on which their Excellencies desired to converse
with the Field Marshal was the proposed Suspension of Hostilities:
they will, probably, after the perusal of his sentiments and
intentions, as above declared, consider any interview with him an
useless waste of time; but, if their Excellencies should still do him
the honour to desire to have an interview with him, the Field Marshal
will be ready to meet them at the time and place they shall appoint.</p>

<p>"The Field Marshal begs their Excellencies will receive the assurance
of his high consideration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:55%;">
"<span class="smcap">Wellington.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From the moment that Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> had become aware of the
retirement of the French troops from Laon upon Soissons, he was most
anxious to secure the passage across the Oise at Compiegne, Verberie,
Pont St Maxence, and Creil.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night of the 25th, he therefore sent an Order for
the Advanced Guard of the First Prussian <i>Corps d'Armée</i> to proceed
on the following day, from Fargnières,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">[Pg 692]</a></span> by forced march, as far as
the first named place. In the afternoon of the 26th, it reached
Noyon, where it halted for a rest, having marched five leagues; and
having nearly an equal distance before it to Compiegne. The twelve
pounder Battery and the four ten pounder Howitzers which had been
attached to this Advanced Guard (the Third Brigade under Major General
<span class="smcap">Jagow</span>) were, by <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Order, left under the
protection of a Battalion, to be employed with the First Brigade,
which was directed to make an attempt upon the Fortress of La Fère.
The Advanced Guard after having sent on a Squadron of the 1st Silesian
Hussars, under Major <span class="smcap">Hertel</span>, to Compiegne, with Orders to push
forward a Detachment thence upon the road to Soissons, resumed its
march in the evening.</p>

<p>It was still in movement about midnight, when Major General
<span class="smcap">Jagow</span> received a communication from the front that Major
<span class="smcap">Hertel</span> had, with his Squadron, entered Compiegne at eight
o'clock in the evening; and had learned from the Mayor that a French
Corps was on the march from Soissons to that town, in which it had
already bespoken ten thousand rations. <span class="smcap">Jagow</span> immediately
communicated this important circumstance to <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>, and
ordered his troops, after another short but indispensable halt, to
continue their toilsome march.</p>

<p>On the morning of this day, the First Brigade of <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s
<i>Corps d'Armée</i> completed the investment of La Fère. The troops that
had been previously detached to this point by General <span class="smcap">Jagow</span>
were moved off to follow this Officer's Brigade on the road to
Compiegne. Notwithstanding the vigorous bombardment which the Prussians
maintained against the Fortress until noon, and by which several
buildings were set on fire, they failed to induce the garrison to
surrender.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">[Pg 693]</a></span></p>

<p>As it was not intended, however, to attempt any more serious attack:
the Brigade, after leaving the Fusilier Battalion of the 12th Regiment
and a Squadron of the Brandenburg Uhlans to watch the Fortress,
followed the <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, which had marched to Noyon; but it did
not even reach Chauny, scarcely seven miles from La Fère.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zieten</span>, on arriving at Chauny at eight o'clock in the evening,
with the remainder of his Corps&mdash;the Second and Fourth Brigades, the
Reserve Artillery, and a Reserve Cavalry Brigade&mdash;considered his troops
too much fatigued to fulfil <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s intentions that they
should march as far as Noyon; and he therefore ordered them to bivouack
at Chauny.</p>

<p>The Third Prussian <i>Corps d'Armée</i> marched from the vicinity of
Homblières to that of Guiscard; partly by Jussy, and partly by St
Quentin and Ham. It was only the Eleventh Brigade, with the greater
portion of the Reserve Cavalry and Artillery, that took the latter
road. These troops on reaching the fortified town of Ham, found it
occupied by the Enemy; who seemed prepared to oppose their passing
through the place. General <span class="smcap">Hobe</span>, who commanded them, summoned
the Commander of the Garrison to open the Gates and allow the troops to
march through; and on perceiving that this summons was disobeyed, he
tried the effect of a few cannon shot, which quickly procured a free
passage for his force. No further notice was taken, and no further use
was made, by the Prussians of this otherwise insignificant place.</p>

<p>A Detachment of the Reserve Cavalry of this Corps was sent to Chauny,
from which it pushed forward a small party along the road towards
Soissons, which the latter pursued until on arriving at about a league
beyond Coucy, it came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_694" id="Page_694">[Pg 694]</a></span> upon an Enemy's Outpost, consisting of a
Regiment of Dragoons and a Battalion of Infantry.</p>

<p>The Fourth <i>Corps d'Armée</i> was also required to make a forced march
on this day&mdash;namely, from Essigny le Grand as far as Lassigny, and
its Advanced Guard was to reach Gournay, and thence push forward
Detachments to Clermont, Creil, and Pont St Maxence, for the purpose of
securing and examining the Bridges across the Oise, and of preparing
all that was requisite for effecting a passage for the troops.
<span class="smcap">Bülow</span>, in his Brigade Orders, drew the attention of his troops
to the necessity which had arisen for those forced marches on the part
of the Prussian Army with a view to obtain a decisive result.</p>

<p>The Advanced Guard started at four o'clock in the morning from Jussy,
and proceeded by Lassigny to Gournay, situated upon the road from
Peronne to Pont St Maxence; but the Detachments which it sent thence
towards Clermont, Creil, Pont St Maxence, and Verberie, did not reach
those places until the following day. The Reserve Artillery of the
Fourth Corps commenced its march at five o'clock in the morning,
following the Advanced Guard, and reached Ressons late in the evening;
where it bivouacked, as did also, subsequently, the main body of the
Corps, after a march of about twenty five miles.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whilst the Prussians were thus, on the 26th, hastening towards
Compiegne; the French General, Count <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>, was, on this
very day, also marching upon that point from Soissons, with the remains
of his <i>Corps d'Armée</i>&mdash;about four thousand men&mdash;having succeeded,
through his urgent representations of the expediency of such a
movement, in obtaining <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s assent to its execution.</p>

<p>The troops of the Third and Fourth French <i>Corps d'Armée</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">[Pg 695]</a></span> moved this
day from Rheims towards Soissons, a distance which they could not,
however, accomplish in one day's march.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The positions of the respective Armies on the evening of the 26th were
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Of the Anglo-Allied Army, the Advanced Guard (<span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s Hussar
Brigade) was at Mattignies, near the Somme, having its Picquets on
that river.</p>

<p>The Second Division, the Nassau troops, and the British Cavalry, were
encamped near Beauvois and Lanchy.</p>

<p>The First and Third Divisions, the Dutch-Belgian Infantry attached to
the First Corps, and the Dutch-Belgian Cavalry, were encamped near
Caulaincourt and Martin de Des Près.</p>

<p>The Fourth Division was encamped at Gouay.</p>

<p>The First British Brigade of Guards was at Peronne.</p>

<p>The Reserve, consisting of the Fifth and Sixth Divisions, the
Brunswick troops, and the Reserve Artillery was encamped near Nourois,
Magny, and Belle Englise.</p>

<p>The Pontoon Train was at Estrées.</p>

<p>The Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Head Quarters were at Vermand.</p>

<p>The Second and Fourth Brigades of the First Prussian <i>Corps d'Armée</i>
were at Chauny, not far from which was also the First Brigade. The
Third Brigade, forming the Advanced Guard, was on the march to
Compiegne.</p>

<p>The Third Corps was at Guiscard.</p>

<p>The Fourth Corps was at Ressons.</p>

<p>Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s Head Quarters were at Genvry, near Noyon.</p>

<p>The French troops under <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span> were not far from Compiegne,
on the road from Soissons. Those of the Third and Fourth Corps, under
<span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>, were at some point between Rheims and Soissons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s Head Quarters were at Soissons.</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was half past four o'clock in the morning of the 27th, when the
Advanced Guard of the Prussian <i>Corps d'Armée</i> (the Third Brigade),
after a forced march of about twenty five miles, reached Compiegne.
General <span class="smcap">Jagow</span> immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">[Pg 696]</a></span> posted his troops, in the most
advantageous manner, in and about the town, so as to be prepared to
meet any attack that the Enemy might make; and detached three Squadrons
of the 1st Silesian Hussars upon the Soissons road, and the remaining
Squadron upon the Paris road, in observation.</p>

<p>About five o'clock, by which time he had scarcely completed his
arrangements, information reached him from the Hussars on the Soissons
road that the Enemy was advancing. This was, as before remarked,
Count <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>, with the remains of his <i>Corps d'Armée</i>; from
which circumstance it will be seen that if <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Advanced
Guard had arrived but a single half hour later, the French would have
anticipated the Prussians in securing the Bridge of Compiegne.</p>

<p>From along the edge of the extensive Wood which adjoins this town, a
fire was quickly opened by the French Skirmishers against the Prussian
Picquets. Very shortly afterwards a Column of Infantry appeared
advancing from their rear. A Half Battery of Prussian Horse Artillery,
which had been posted on the Soissons road, in front of the Gate on
that side of the town, having allowed the Column to approach within a
suitable range, directed a fire upon it with such vigour and precision,
that in a few moments more the mass rushed for shelter into the Wood.</p>

<p>Four French guns were now brought forward, and these replied to the
Prussian Artillery; during which the Enemy moved through the Wood
to his left. The Prussians concluded from this movement that he
contemplated abandoning the attack in this quarter, for the purpose
of assailing the lower and weaker side of the town, by the Crespy and
Paris roads: but on renewing his advance, he soon showed that he was
only masking his retreat; whereupon the 1st<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697">[Pg 697]</a></span> Silesian Hussars advanced
along the road to Soissons in pursuit.</p>

<p>By the result of this affair, which lasted an hour and a half but was
limited to a cannonade and mutual <i>tiraillade</i>, the French were foiled
in their attempt to cover their retreat by securing Compiegne, and
checking the advance of the Prussians along the Oise.</p>

<p>The Third Prussian Brigade, however, which had continually formed
the Advanced Guard of the First <i>Corps d'Armée</i> since the Battle of
Waterloo, was too much exhausted by its efforts during the previous day
and night, to attempt seriously to molest the Enemy during his retreat;
a circumstance of which the latter failed not to take advantage.
<span class="smcap">Zieten</span> decided upon relieving these troops from the duties of
an Advanced Guard by the Second Brigade; which, however, had not yet
come up: and hence the French gained some valuable time.</p>

<p>The main body of <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Corps did not reach Compiegne until
mid day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, who had already arrived there, ordered that the
Advanced Guard (now consisting of the Second Brigade) and the Reserve
Cavalry, preceded by one hundred Riflemen, should march through the
Wood towards Villers Cotterets, followed by the main body of the Corps;
it having been his intention to throw these troops upon the Enemy's
line of retreat, in the event of the Advanced Guard falling in with
French troops at or near that point.</p>

<p>This Order, however, was not strictly followed by <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>, who
marched the main body of his Corps, including the Reserve Cavalry, and
the Reserve Artillery, through the Wood of Compiegne to Gillicourt,
detaching only his Second Brigade, reinforced by the Brandenburg
Dragoons and five pieces of Horse Artillery, towards Villers Cotterets.
The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">[Pg 698]</a></span> 1st Silesian Hussars were pushed forward upon the road from
Compiegne to Soissons, to cover the Left Flank during this movement.
The Reserve Cavalry, in front of the Column of the main body, reached
Gillicourt just as the Enemy (under Count <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>) had crossed
the Defile formed by a tributary stream of the Oise in which that place
is situated. The 1st West Prussian Dragoons and the Brandenburg Uhlans,
together with a Horse Battery, went on in pursuit; and the Third
Brigade was ordered to follow the latter in support. The Fourth Brigade
was directed to maintain the Defile of Gillicourt.</p>

<p>The Enemy's Rear Guard was overtaken on this side of Crespy by the two
Regiments of Cavalry, which threw it back in disorder upon that town.
The French quickly retired from the place; whereupon the Third Brigade,
with a Cavalry Brigade, bivouacked there, throwing out parties of
Dragoons in the direction of the Enemy's retreat.</p>

<p>The Fourth Brigade, the other Cavalry Brigade, and the Reserve
Artillery, bivouacked at Gillicourt. The Second Brigade, with the
additional force attached to it, as before mentioned, reached Longpré,
not far from Villers Cotterets, in the middle of the night. The long
march which the troops of the First <i>Corps d'Armée</i> made this day
from Noyon, and the probability of their coming into collision with
the Enemy on the following day, rendered a few hours' rest absolutely
necessary.</p>

<p>Separated from one another as <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Brigades thus were,
a strong Support was essentially requisite; and this was supplied in
good time by the Third Prussian <i>Corps d'Armée</i> which marched on this
day from Guiscard to Compiegne. Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> directed its
Commander, <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>, to detach strongly towards Soissons;
for the purpose of observing the Enemy, and of molesting him should
he be retiring. The Cavalry thus detached pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">[Pg 699]</a></span>senting the means of
covering <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Left Flank; the 1st Silesian Hussars, which
had been previously posted on the Soissons road, were directed to
rejoin their own Corps. The Third Corps bivouacked on the left bank of
the Oise, with the exception of the Twelfth Brigade which remained on
the right bank at Venette.</p>

<p>On the same day, the Fourth Prussian <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, forming the Right
Column, marched from Ressons and its vicinity, with Orders to cross the
Oise lower down the stream, at Verberie, Pont St Maxence, or Creil.
<span class="smcap">Bülow</span> formed his Advanced Guard with the 3rd Neumark Landwehr,
a Battalion of the 1st Silesian Landwehr, the 8th Hussars, the 1st
Pomeranian Landwehr Cavalry, and half the Horse Battery No. 12, and
desired General <span class="smcap">Sydow</span>, who commanded the Advanced Guard, to
move off with a Detachment, at the first break of day, and secure the
Bridge over the Oise at Creil.</p>

<p>This General, aware of the importance of attaining the object in view,
proceeded himself, at the head of a Squadron of the 8th Hussars, and
of one hundred Infantry, the latter being transported in carts, and
reached Creil with his small Detachment just as the French were on the
point of entering the place. The latter were immediately attacked and
repulsed: and the Prussian Infantry occupied the Bridge; which, on
the arrival of the Advanced Guard, was given over to the 1st Silesian
Landwehr, whilst the remainder of the troops, after a short halt,
commenced their march upon Senlis.</p>

<p>Another striking instance was thus again afforded of the vast
importance of a correct calculation of time in military operations. The
Prussians, on this morning, reached the Bridge of Compiegne, only half
an hour before the French approached it; and had they arrived at Creil
but a few minutes later, they would have found the French in possession
of the Bridge at this point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">[Pg 700]</a></span></p>

<p>Major <span class="smcap">Blankenburg</span> was detached in advance, with the 1st
Pomeranian Landwehr Cavalry, from Creil towards Senlis. They had but
just reached this town, and had begun to bivouack on the great market
place; when, towards nine o'clock in the evening, <span class="smcap">Kellermann</span>,
with the First <i>Cuirassier</i> Brigade of French Cavalry, approached
on the opposite side, and made a dash at the very spot occupied by
the Prussians. Major <span class="smcap">Blankenburg</span> had barely time to mount;
nevertheless, with such of his men as were accoutred and prepared, he
attacked the French horsemen, and drove them back to the Gates of the
town. The latter, however, collecting their strength, renewed their
attack, overpowered the Prussians; and forced them to retire along the
road to Pont St Maxence. <span class="smcap">Kellermann</span>'s Brigade then resumed
its march along the prescribed line of retreat. In the mean time, his
Second <i>Cuirassier</i> Brigade, and <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s French <i>Corps
d'Armée</i>, were retiring along the same road towards Senlis.</p>

<p>Upon this point also General <span class="smcap">Sydow</span> was moving from Creil, with
the Advanced Guard of the Fourth Prussian Corps; following, as it was
supposed, the detached 1st Pomeranian Landwehr Cavalry. On reaching
Senlis at ten o'clock in the evening, with the head of the Column,
consisting of the 8th Hussars and the 3rd Battalion of the 3rd Neumark
Landwehr, and finding the place unoccupied, he took possession of it.
The French troops had already approached close to the town, from the
side of Crespy. The Prussian Infantry were immediately posted in the
houses nearest to the Gate: and as soon as the Enemy's Cavalry came
fully within the effective range of musketry, they suddenly opened upon
the latter a sharp fire; which compelled it to go about.</p>

<p>The head of <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s Corps now came up; but was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701">[Pg 701]</a></span> forced,
along with the Cavalry, to take another direction. <span class="smcap">Sydow</span>,
having collected the whole of the Advanced Guard, followed the French
some little distance; and bivouacked, about midnight, somewhat in
advance of Senlis. The latter, however, reached, next morning, the road
leading through Gonesse to Paris.</p>

<p>During the operation of the Advanced Guard of the Fourth Prussian
<i>Corps d'Armée</i>, another Detachment of the latter was sent to occupy
Pont St Maxence and Verberie. The French having partially destroyed
the Bridge at the former point, the 2nd Pomeranian Landwehr Cavalry
were ferried to the opposite bank of the river, and Detachments were
immediately pushed on to Verberie and Senlis. The Fourteenth Brigade
followed the Cavalry, and was passed over the river in a similar
manner; after which it occupied the Heights on both sides of the great
Paris road. These troops bivouacked for the night on their position;
whilst the main body of the Corps, on reaching Pont St Maxence,
remained on the right bank of the river. The greatest activity was used
in repairing the Bridge sufficiently for the passage of Artillery.</p>

<p>In this manner <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> had effectually secured the line of the
Oise; and, by pushing forward his Advanced Troops as far as Villers
Cotterets, had closed so much upon the Flank of the retiring Enemy,
that he had every reasonable expectation of succeeding in cutting off
the line of retreat of the latter upon the capital.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>, on discovering that the Detachments he had thrown
out to gain the passages of the Oise, on his left, had been thwarted
by the rapidity of the Prussian movement, and had been compelled to
fall back, now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_702" id="Page_702">[Pg 702]</a></span> employed them in covering his retreat by means of
partial combats. Hence arose the engagements at Compiegne, Crespy,
and Senlis; but such was the feebleness of the French resistance, and
so frequent were the desertions of the soldiers, who threw away their
arms, and fled to their homes, that it was evident the reorganisation
of the Army, and the reanimation of its former spirit, were far from
having been thoroughly effected. It has been said that a cry of alarm
spread through its ranks of, "Our retreat is cut off!" as soon as it
was known that the Prussians were upon its Right Flank. At all events
it appears tolerably certain that the Army was not in that state which
would have warranted <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> in risking any serious stand
against the Prussians. To succeed in reaching the capital by means of
forced marches; and to secure his troops, as far as practicable, from
molestation, was all that he could hope to accomplish.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the 27th, the main body of the Anglo-Allied Army, crossing the Somme
at Willecourt, marched through Nesle upon Roye.</p>

<p>The Fourth Division marched through Peronne, towards Roye.</p>

<p>Two Battalions of the Dutch-Belgian Brigade at Peronne were ordered to
remain in occupation of that place: the remainder of the Brigade, and
the Brigade of Guards at Peronne, marched through Nesle to the village
of Crescy, and joined the First Corps.</p>

<p>The Fifth Division, the Brunswick Cavalry, and the Reserve Brigade of
Howitzers, moved upon Ham.</p>

<p>The Sixth Division, the Brunswick Infantry, and the Reserve Artillery,
encamped between the villages of Douilly and Villers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_703" id="Page_703">[Pg 703]</a></span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the precautions which the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>
had taken to ensure the orderly conduct of his troops, and to
conciliate in their favour the good disposition of the inhabitants
along the line of march, it being his anxious desire that they should
be considered as being on a friendly footing, and as acting on behalf
of the legitimate Sovereign, there was one portion of his Army which
committed the greatest excesses: these were the Dutch-Belgian troops,
who set his Orders on this head completely at defiance. They pillaged
wherever they went, not even excepting the Head Quarters, the house
which he himself occupied: they forced the safeguards, and rescued, at
the point of the bayonet, the prisoners from the <i>Gensd'armerie</i> which
the Duke had formed for the Police of the Army.</p>

<p>Two of the Officers had just rendered themselves conspicuous by
participating in, and actually encouraging, these disorders, which had
arisen to such a height as to arouse his Grace's just indignation and
severe censure. He desired the General Officer then in command of that
part of the Army to put in full force his General Order of the 26th of
June, to cause a Roll Call of Companies to be made every hour, and to
see that every Officer and soldier was present. He also directed him to
place the two Officers before alluded to in arrest, and to send them to
the Hague, to be disposed of by the King of the Netherlands; to whom
he forwarded a copy of the letter containing these instructions. This
letter, which strongly evidenced the feelings of annoyance, under which
the Duke wrote it, concluding with the following cutting reproof:&mdash;<i>Je
ne veux pas commander de tels Officiers. Je suis assez longtemps Soldat
pour savoir que les Pillards, et ceux qui les encouragent, ne valent
rien devant l'Ennemi; et je n'en veux pas</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_704" id="Page_704">[Pg 704]</a></span></p>

<p>The following were the positions of the respective Armies on the
evening of the 27th:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The First Prussian. <i>Corps d'Armée</i> had its main body at Gillicourt;
its Second Brigade at Longpré, about half a league from Villers
Cotterets; and its Third Brigade at Crespy.</p>

<p>The main body of the Third Prussian <i>Corps d'Armée</i> was at Compiegne;
it had strong Detachments in the direction of Soissons.</p>

<p>The main body of the Fourth Prussian Corps was at Pont St Maxence;
it had its Advanced Guard at Senlis, and Detachments at Creil and
Verberie.</p>

<p>Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s Head Quarters were at Compiegne.</p>

<p>Of the Anglo-Allied Army, the Second Division, the Nassau troops, and
the British and Hanoverian Cavalry, were in the vicinity of Roye.</p>

<p>The Third Division, one Brigade of the First Division, the
Dutch-Belgian Infantry attached to the First Corps, and the
Dutch-Belgian Cavalry, were encamped near the villages of Crescy,
Billencourt, and Bereuil.</p>

<p>The Fourth Division was at the village of Puzeaux, on the road to Roye.</p>

<p>The Brigade of Guards was at Crescy.</p>

<p>The Fifth Division and the Brunswick Cavalry were at Ham.</p>

<p>The Sixth Division, the Brunswick Infantry, and the Reserve Artillery,
were between the villages of Douilly and Villers.</p>

<p>The Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Head Quarters were at Nesle.</p>

<p>The remains of the First and Second French <i>Corps d'Armée</i>,
Detachments from which had this day been defeated at Compiegne,
Crespy, Creil, and Senlis, were in full retreat, partly upon the
Senlis, and partly upon the Soissons, road.</p>

<p>The Imperial Guard and the Sixth Corps were at Villers Cotterets.</p>

<p>The Third and Fourth Corps were at Soissons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>'s Head Quarters were at Villers Cotterets.</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>General <span class="smcap">Pirch II.</span> having learned, upon his arrival at one
o'clock of the morning of the 28th, with the Advanced Guard of the
First Prussian <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, at Longpré, near Villers Cotterets,
that the latter place was not occupied by the Enemy in any force,
determined to capture the place forthwith by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_705" id="Page_705">[Pg 705]</a></span> a surprise. The troops
detached to the front on this service (the Fusilier Battalion of the
6th Regiment and the Brandenburg Dragoons), favoured by the darkness
(which as yet was scarcely relieved by the approaching dawn), as also
by the Wood through which they advanced, fell upon a Detachment that
was moving by a by road through the Wood, consisting of a French Horse
Battery of fourteen guns, twenty ammunition waggons, and an escort of
one hundred and fifty men. The whole vicinity of Villers Cotterets was,
in fact, filled with French troops; thus dispersed, that they might
sooner obtain refreshment after the long march, and be prepared to
start again at two o'clock in the morning. Thus they were all in motion
at the time of this capture.</p>

<p>General <span class="smcap">Pirch</span> now pushed on to Villers Cotterets, where the
Prussians made many prisoners. <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> himself narrowly
escaped being taken as he was mounting his horse and hastening out of
the opposite side of the town. On reaching the Windmill Height upon
the road to Nanteuil, he succeeded in collecting together and forming
his troops. <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>, after detaching Cavalry in pursuit of the
Enemy, as also towards Longpré to cover his Right, and towards Soissons
to protect his Left, took up a defensive position. He deployed his
Infantry, with the Foot Battery, upon the Height at the Garden of the
Château, posted two Battalions at the point of a Wood that jutted out
on his right; and was still occupied in making his arrangements, when a
Cavalry Detachment, on the Soissons road, sent in word that a hostile
Corps was to be seen approaching from Soissons. Another report was
received immediately afterwards, that the Enemy showed much Cavalry on
that side, and was already detaching two Regiments of the latter Arm
towards the Prussian Left Flank; as also another Cavalry force,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706">[Pg 706]</a></span> along
with from twenty to twenty five pieces of artillery against the Right
Flank.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the French Marshal had collected about nine thousand
men on the Height before mentioned, near the road to Nanteuil; one
third of whom had already constituted the Rear Guard, and the remainder
was composed of troops that had halted during the night in the
vicinity, as at Vauciennes, Coyolles, and Pisseleux. With these troops,
<span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> showed every disposition to accept an engagement.</p>

<p>General <span class="smcap">Pirch II.</span>, finding himself thus critically situated
between two separate and overpowering hostile forces, prepared to
effect his retreat.</p>

<p>This was facilitated in a peculiar manner. The troops of
<span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>'s Corps, perceiving the Prussians thus posted on the
high road to Paris, and imagining their force to be greater than it
really was, fell into the greatest disorder, and with loud cries of
"Into the woods on the left, towards La Ferté Milon&mdash;we are cut off
from Paris!" they all rushed in that direction; with the exception of
two thousand men and some guns conducted by <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span> himself
by the way of Pisseleux, leaving Villers Cotterets on their right, and
masking the movement by a vigorous attack upon this place. The 6th
Prussian Regiment was driven back by the Enemy's superior numbers;
and <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>, after having kept up a brisk cannonade, gradually
withdrew the Regiment from Villers Cotterets, for the purpose of moving
upon Crespy, the direction previously laid down for him, with a view to
the concentration of the Corps.</p>

<p>As <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> was moving by the Soissons road towards Nanteuil,
<span class="smcap">Pirch</span> was desirous of proceeding in a parallel direction,
through Longpré; but he was subsequently induced, on consideration of
the Defiles in that direction, and which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_707" id="Page_707">[Pg 707]</a></span> he did not deem it prudent
to pass so near to the Enemy, to prefer retiring along the Compiegne
road, as far as where it is joined by the one leading from Viviers; and
where, for the covering of the Left Flank and Rear, a Squadron of the
Brandenburg Dragoons had already been posted. From this point he struck
into the road leading by Buts, and reached, towards mid day, Frenois la
Rivière, where he gave his troops a few hours' rest; and then proceeded
by Crespy to Nanteuil, which place he reached about nine o'clock in the
evening, having marched twenty one leagues within the last thirty eight
hours, during six of which he had also been engaged with the Enemy.
He had succeeded in creating confusion in one portion of the retiring
French force, and in impeding the retreat of that which was with
<span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> himself sufficiently long to enable <span class="smcap">Zieten</span> to
anticipate the latter in his arrival at Nanteuil.</p>

<p>It has already been explained, when describing the proceedings of the
27th, how much separated the Brigades of the First Prussian <span class="smcap">Corps
d'Armée</span> were from one another. The First was still on the march
from La Fère (it rejoined on the afternoon of this day); the Second,
with the Brandenburg Dragoons, was near Villers Cotterets; the Third,
with a Cavalry Brigade, was at Crespy; and the Fourth, with the other
Cavalry Brigade was at Gillicourt. Hence <span class="smcap">Zieten</span> was desirous,
on the morning of the 28th, to concentrate his Corps at Crespy;
leaving only a strong Cavalry Detachment at Villers Cotterets. But
whilst despatching the Order to <span class="smcap">Pirch</span> to move upon Crespy; he
received a report from this General, that he had fallen upon the French
troops retreating through Villers Cotterets, and was upon the point of
being driven back by superior numbers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_708" id="Page_708">[Pg 708]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zieten</span>, considering that the Prussian troops at Crespy, the
nearest to Villers Cotterets, were nearly three leagues distant from
the latter point, decided upon not attempting to give any direct
support to <span class="smcap">Pirch</span>; but to advance with the Third Brigade,
together with the Reserve Cavalry and Artillery, towards Levignon, on
the great Paris road, between Villers Cotterets and Nanteuil, and, if
possible, occupy that point before the French could reach it. He found
the latter in the act of marching through the village; and immediately
ordered a Howitzer Battery to be drawn up, which commenced throwing
shells into the place. He also ordered the 1st West Prussian Dragoons,
and the 1st Silesian Hussars, with a Horse Battery, to attack the Enemy.</p>

<p>The French, however, retired in such haste, that they were not
overtaken until about midway between Levignon and Nanteuil; when they
halted their Rear Guard, which made front against the Prussians. They
comprised the Second <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, under <span class="smcap">Reille</span>, who had
with him several Regiments of Cavalry, and continued their march;
supporting, however, the Rear Guard. On coming up with the latter, two
Squadrons of the 2nd West Prussian Dragoons charged; but they were
repulsed, and attacked in flank by a French Regiment of Lancers. The
Enemy now advanced, with the hope of completely routing the Prussian
Cavalry. This attempt failed in consequence of a most successful attack
by the 1st Silesian Hussars; by which the French were put to flight,
and two of their guns captured. The Horse Battery drew up, at the
same time, on the left of the high road, and, by its effective fire,
committed great havoc amidst the flying Enemy; who was pursued by the
Prussian Cavalry even beyond Nanteuil.</p>

<p>During the movement upon Levignon, General <span class="smcap">Hobe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709">[Pg 709]</a></span></span> came up
with a Cavalry Brigade from the Third <i>Corps d'Armée</i>. It advanced by
the right, along the road from Crespy to Nanteuil, with the design
of intercepting a portion of the Enemy's retreating Columns; but the
French, in the mean time, fled in such haste, that only a few prisoners
were made.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the pressure thus made upon the French line of retreat,
Count <span class="smcap">Reille</span> succeeded in uniting the remains of his <i>Corps
d'Armée</i> with those of Count <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s Corps which had escaped
through Crespy and by the left of Senlis.</p>

<p>The French Imperial Guards, and the Sixth <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, which were
under the more immediate orders of <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>, and had formed the
Column that retired through Villers Cotterets in the morning, reached
Levignon after <span class="smcap">Zieten</span> had passed through it in pursuit of
<span class="smcap">Reille</span>'s troops to Nanteuil; and becoming acquainted with
the danger of their proceeding further on that road, they turned off
to their left, to make their retreat through Assy, Meaux, Claye, and
Vincennes.</p>

<p>General <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>, who, with the Third and Fourth French <i>Corps
d'Armée</i>, was most in the rear, and had withdrawn from the high road at
Villers Cotterets on perceiving the Prussian Brigade in possession of
that place, took the direction of La Ferté Milon, Meaux, crossing the
Marne at L'Agny, to Paris.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bülow</span>, who had been directed to move the Fourth <i>Corps
d'Armée</i> from Pont St Maxence to Marly la Ville, on the 28th, deemed it
advisable to augment his Advanced Guard; and therefore added to it the
Fourteenth Brigade and the Reserve Cavalry, and placed the whole under
the command of Prince <span class="smcap">William</span> of Prussia. In the afternoon
Prince <span class="smcap">William</span> fell upon Detachments of <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>'s,
and also upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710">[Pg 710]</a></span> <span class="smcap">Reille</span>'s <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, which latter was
retreating from Nanteuil. He immediately attacked the Enemy, dispersed
a great number of his troops, and took more than two thousand
prisoners. It was evening before the Advanced Guard reached Gonesse,
where it bivouacked. Detachments were pushed on to the front as far as
Le Bourget and Stains, which points were occupied by the Enemy. The
main body of the Corps arrived at Marly la Ville in the evening, and
halted there for the night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>, having been directed to proceed with the Third
<i>Corps d'Armée</i> from Compiegne to Senlis, should its support not be
required by the First Corps, marched his Infantry and Artillery upon
Crespy, and sent the Reserve Cavalry by Verberie; but on hearing that
the First Corps was engaged with the Enemy, he drew in his Cavalry
towards Crespy, from Verberie, as soon as it arrived there. The First
Cavalry Brigade, with six pieces of Horse Artillery, was pushed on from
Crespy, along the road to Nanteuil; where it joined the Reserve Cavalry
of the First <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, but not in time to take any active
part in the engagement at that place. The Second Cavalry Brigade was
detached towards Villers Cotterets. The main body of the Third <i>Corps
d'Armée</i> bivouacked for the night at Crespy and its vicinity.</p>

<p>Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> deemed it advisable to send, on this day, a
strong Detachment of Cavalry, consisting of the Queen's Dragoons,
under Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Kamecke</span>, beyond the Left of the
First Prussian Corps, towards the Marne, for the purpose of gaining
intelligence of the Enemy's movements in that direction. Lieutenant
Colonel <span class="smcap">Kamecke</span> was instructed to act discretionally; and to
proceed, subsequently, by Meaux, or Château Thierry, and endeavour to
open a communication with the Advance of the Bavarian Army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">[Pg 711]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that, on the 28th, the Prussian Army succeeded in
cutting off the line of retreat of the French troops by the Soissons
high road, compelling the greater portion of them to seek, along cross
roads, the line of the Marne, by Meaux and L'Agny. It had, since it
crossed the Oise, created great disorder and confusion in the French
ranks, captured sixteen pieces of cannon, and made, altogether, four
thousand prisoners. The Prussians now occupied both the high roads
leading from Senlis and Soissons, and had their Advanced Posts (those
of the Fourth <i>Corps d'Armée</i>) within five miles of Paris.</p>

<p>The sound of their cannon was already heard in the capital, where the
greatest consternation prevailed amongst the citizens; whose fears had
been previously excited by the most exaggerated reports brought in by
fugitives from the retreating Army. The fortified works that had been
thrown up on the north side, appeared sufficient to check the progress
of the Allied Armies, and to secure Paris from a <i>coup de main</i>;
but time was essential for the organisation of the defence, for the
recovery of the exhausted remains of the Army of the North expected
to arrive on the morrow, and for the collection of every available
defensive means. It was only by the assumption of a sufficiently
respectable, if not an imposing, attitude, that they could hope to
succeed in negotiating for the preservation of the capital and the
establishment of their own prescribed form of government&mdash;perhaps, by
some extraordinary effort, to disconcert the plans of their Enemies,
and obtain a triumph under the walls of Paris.</p>

<p>Actuated by these considerations, the Provisional Government was
desirous of inducing the victorious Commanders of the Allied Armies to
enter into negotiations. Another Commission was appointed, the members
of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_712" id="Page_712">[Pg 712]</a></span> were Messrs <span class="smcap">Andreossy</span>, <span class="smcap">Valence</span>, <span class="smcap">Boissy
d'Anglas</span>, <span class="smcap">Flangergues</span>, and <span class="smcap">la Benardière</span>. They
were directed to proceed to the Head Quarters of the Allied Field
Marshals, again to solicit a Suspension of Hostilities and to negotiate
an Armistice.</p>

<p>During these proceedings in Paris, a renewed application had been
received by Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, on the 27th, and by the Duke of
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span> on the 28th, from the first named Commissioners,
for a Suspension of Hostilities; as also a request that a passport and
assurances of safety might be accorded to <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> and his
family, to enable them to pass to the United States of America: the
Provisional Government having previously succeeded, through the medium
of representations made to the ex-Emperor by some of his friends, in
persuading the latter to consent to this step.</p>

<p>Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> declined taking any notice of the application,
conceiving his former verbal reply quite sufficient. The Duke of
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span> referred the Commissioners to his note of the 26th
on the proposed Suspension of Hostilities; and stated that, with regard
to the passport for <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, he had no authority from his
Government, or from the Allies, to give any answer to such demand.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Allied Army advanced this day from Nesle, so as to bring its
Right in rear of St Just, and its Left in rear of La Taulle, where the
high road from Compiegne joins the high road from Roye to Paris.</p>

<p>The Second Corps, under Lord <span class="smcap">Hill</span>, as also the British and
Hanoverian Cavalry, marched by Montdidier to Petit Crevec&oelig;ur.</p>

<p>The First Corps, under Sir <span class="smcap">John Byng</span>, marched upon Couchy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_713" id="Page_713">[Pg 713]</a></span></p>

<p>The Reserve, under Sir <span class="smcap">James Kempt</span>, marched upon Roye.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following were the positions of the respective Armies on the
evening of the 28th:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Fourth Prussian <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, which was the nearest to Paris,
was posted at Marly la Ville; having Detachments pushed forward close
to Le Bourget and Stains.</p>

<p>The First Prussian <i>Corps d'Armée</i> stood in rear of Nanteuil; having
its Advanced Guard at Le Plessis, Belleville, and Dammartin.</p>

<p>The Third <i>Corps d'Armée</i> was at Crespy and in its vicinity.</p>

<p>Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s Head Quarters were at Senlis.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Allied Army had its Right behind St Just and its Left behind
La Taulle.</p>

<p>Its Reserve was at Roye.</p>

<p>The Advanced Guard (<span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s Hussar Brigade) was at Antheuil.</p>

<p>The Second and Fourth Divisions, the Nassau troops, and the Hanoverian
Cavalry, were encamped at Petit Crevec&oelig;ur, on the road to St Just.</p>

<p>The British Cavalry was encamped near La Taulle and Ressons.</p>

<p>The First and Third Divisions, and the Dutch-Belgian troops, were
encamped near Couchy.</p>

<p>The Fifth and Sixth Divisions, the Brunswick troops, and Reserve
Artillery, were encamped near Roye.</p>

<p>The Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Head Quarters were at Orville.</p>

<p>The remains of the First and Second French <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, after
forming a junction at Gonesse, where the high roads from Nanteuil and
Senlis unite, reached the suburbs of Paris. The Imperial Guard and the
Sixth Corps, immediately under <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>, were in full retreat
from Meaux by Claie and Vincennes. The Third and Fourth Corps, under
<span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>, having crossed the Marne at Meaux, were retreating
by Lagny and Vincennes.</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Blücher</span> having issued Orders, during the night of the 28th,
for the continuation of the advance upon Paris; the Advanced Guard of
the Fourth Prussian <i>Corps d'Armée</i> moved, on the morning of the 29th,
from Gonesse to Le<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_714" id="Page_714">[Pg 714]</a></span> Bourget, which place it found abandoned by the
Enemy; who, however, was strongly posted at St Denis, towards which
point therefore, some Battalions were pushed forward in observation.
The Enemy having been driven out of Stains, this Post was occupied by
two Fusilier Battalions and a Regiment of Cavalry, under Lieutenant
Colonel <span class="smcap">Schill</span>, for the purpose of securing the Right Flank
of the Corps. La Cour Neuve, between St Denis and Le Bourget, was also
occupied. The main body of the Corps broke up from Marly la Ville at
seven o'clock in the morning; and on reaching Le Bourget, bivouacked in
its vicinity.</p>

<p>The Advanced Guard of the First Prussian <i>Corps d'Armée</i> pushed on, at
daybreak, from Dammartin to Blanc Mesnil; whence, immediately on its
arrival, it sent Detachments beyond the Wood of Bondy, to reconnoitre
the Enemy's preparations of defence. The main body of this Corps took
up a position, having its Right resting on Blanc Mesnil, and its Left
on Aulnay. It sent out Infantry Detachments towards Livry, and along
the Ourcq Canal, towards Bondy and Pantin; and Cavalry parties towards
Grande Drancey and Banbigny. <span class="smcap">Zieten</span> also occupied Nonneville
with the 7th Regiment of Infantry; and the 6th Uhlans furnished
Outposts at the Ourcq Canal, communicating with those of the Fourth
Corps.</p>

<p>The Third Prussian <i>Corps d'Armée</i> marched from Crespy as far as
Dammartin, in the vicinity of which it was bivouacked.</p>

<p>The Reserve Cavalry was sent forward as far as Tremblay, in direct
support of the First <i>Corps d'Armée</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The First and Second French <i>Corps d'Armée</i> had reached the suburbs
of Paris on the Gonesse road, during the night; and held possession
of Le Bourget until the morning of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_715" id="Page_715">[Pg 715]</a></span> 29th. The Imperial Guard and
the Sixth Corps, as also the reinforcements that had arrived from the
interior, were, during the forenoon of the 29th, on the high road by
Claie and Pantin, under the command of <span class="smcap">Grouchy</span>; and were
directed to occupy several defensive points on that side. The Third and
Fourth <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, under <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>, reached Paris at noon
on the 29th, by the Lagny road: they passed through the capital, and
occupied the Heights of Montrouge on the south side.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Anglo-Allied Army arrived, on the 29th, at different points on the
road between Gournay and Pont St Maxence.</p>

<p>The Advanced Guard, consisting of <span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s Light Cavalry
Brigade, supported by that of <span class="smcap">Arentsschildt</span>, crossed the Oise
at Pont St Maxence, and reached Senlis.</p>

<p>The British Cavalry moved from La Taulle to Pont St Maxence.</p>

<p>The Second Corps, under Lord <span class="smcap">Hill</span>, moved from Petit
Crevec&oelig;ur to Clermont.</p>

<p>The First Corps, under Sir <span class="smcap">John Byng</span>, moved from its camp near
Couchy, by Estrée St Denis, along the high road to St Martin Longeau.</p>

<p>The Reserve, under Sir <span class="smcap">James Kempt</span>, moved from its camp near
Roye, to Gournay, on the road to Pont St Maxence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following were the positions of the respective Armies on the
evening of the 29th:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The First Prussian <i>Corps d'Armée</i> had its Advanced Guard and Reserve
Cavalry at Aulnay and Savegny; with Detachments of the latter at
Serran, Livry, Bondy, and Baubigny. The Fusilier Battalion of the 7th
Regiment stood at Nonneville. The 6th Uhlans and the 1st Silesian
Hussars, with two Horse Batteries, were posted along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_716" id="Page_716">[Pg 716]</a></span> Ourcq Canal.
The Corps itself rested its Right on Blanc Mesnil, and its Left on
Aulnay.</p>

<p>The Third <i>Corps d'Armée</i> was at Dammartin and in its vicinity. Its
Reserve Cavalry stood at Tremblay, in support of <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>.</p>

<p>The Fourth Corps had its Advanced Guard between Le Bourget and St
Denis, which it invested. Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">von Schill</span>, with
the 1st Silesian Landwehr Cavalry and two Battalions of Infantry, was
posted at Stains. The Corps itself was at Le Bourget.</p>

<p>Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s Head Quarters were at Gonesse.</p>

<p>The Advanced Guard of the Anglo-Allied Army was at Senlis.</p>

<p>The British Cavalry was at Pont St Maxence.</p>

<p>The Second and Fourth Divisions, the Nassau troops, and
<span class="smcap">Estorff</span>'s Light Cavalry, were at Clermont.</p>

<p>The First and Third Divisions, and the Dutch-Belgian troops, were at
St Martin Longeau.</p>

<p>The Fifth and Sixth Divisions, the Brunswick troops, and the Reserve
Artillery, were at Gournay.</p>

<p>The Pontoon Train and Hawser Bridges were at Estrée St Denis.</p>

<p>The Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Head Quarters were at Le Plessis
Longeau.</p>

<p>The French troops comprising the Army of the North had entered the
capital.</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The French force in the capital, after the arrival of the Army that
had been defeated in Belgium, consisted as follows:&mdash;The troops under
<span class="smcap">Grouchy</span> including the Depôts that had come up from the
district of the Loire and from other parts of the interior, amounted to
60 or 70,000 men. They were reinforced, also, by a very considerable
amount of Field Artillery. One portion of these troops was posted at
Montmartre, at St Denis, and in rear of the Ourcq Canal: the remainder,
under <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>, occupied the Heights of Montrouge, on the
opposite side, with the exception of the Cavalry, which lay in the
Wood of Boulogne. The National Guards amounted to about 30,000 men:
their disposition, however, was very doubtful; and, in general, they
were considered as but little disposed to offer any resistance to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_717" id="Page_717">[Pg 717]</a></span>
the Allied Armies. There was another description of force called the
Federal <i>Tirailleurs</i>, raised in the suburbs, and consisting chiefly
of Veterans: they amounted to 17,000 men. Hence, setting aside the
National Guard, there remained, for the defence of Paris, a disposable
force of about 80 or 90,000 men, besides a numerous Artillery. Marshal
<span class="smcap">Davoust</span>, Prince of <span class="smcap">Eckmühl</span>, was appointed to the
chief command of the French Army, and his Head Quarters were fixed at
La Villette.</p>

<p>The measures which had been adopted for taking advantage of the local
capabilities of defence which the capital afforded, consisted in the
intrenchments that had been raised around the Heights of Montmartre,
Monfauçon, and Belleville. An advanced line of defence was presented
by the Ourcq Canal; which, proceeding through the Wood of Bondy and
contiguously to the high road from Meaux, has an arm that branches off
from Pantin towards St Denis. This Canal, which was thirty feet wide
but not entirely completed, had been filled with water. Along its inner
bank ran a high dam, forming an excellent parapet, in which embrasures
were cut to admit heavy ordnance; and St Denis, which formed the <i>point
d'appui</i> of this line of defence on the Seine, was strongly fortified.
The ground on the north side of this town, too, had been inundated by
means of the little rivers Rouillon and La Vieille Mer. The Village of
Aubervilliers, which formed an Advanced Post at musket shot distance
from the line, was occupied: and in rear of it the Canal was covered by
a sort of <i>tête de pont</i>, which secured the communication between both
banks. The Barriers to the several approaches to Paris were covered
by works with strong batteries. Vincennes had been strengthened, and
covered by the works which defended La Pissotte. A strong <i>tête de
pont</i> was also constructed upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_718" id="Page_718">[Pg 718]</a></span> the left bank of the Marne, to cover
the Bridge of Charenton. All ferries and boats upon the Seine and the
Marne were transported to the left bank. The Bridge of Neuilly had
been partially destroyed; and the wooden Bridge at Bessons, over the
Seine, had been burned. Several villages, parks, and gardens, on the
right bank of the Seine and the Marne, were rendered defensible by
the walls being crenelated, the approaches barricaded, and the gates
blocked up. Upon the left bank of the Seine, on the south side of the
capital, preparations for defence were comparatively neglected; they
were limited to the Heights of Montrouge.</p>

<p>For the defence of the principal works, three hundred guns of large
calibre were supplied; and for the manning of these, twenty Companies
of Marine Artillery, which had been brought into the capital. The
line between St Denis and Vincennes was defended by the First,
Second, and Sixth <i>Corps d'Armée</i>. The Imperial Guard formed the
Reserve, and was posted at Menil Montant. The Cavalry was stationed
in the Bois de Boulogne. The Third and Fourth <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, under
<span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>, defended the south side of Paris, and occupied
Montrouge.</p>

<p>In the midst of all these preparations, the Provisional Government,
the majority of which, under the influence of <span class="smcap">Fouché</span>, was
most desirous of effecting a cessation of hostilities, though acting
ostensibly upon the grounds of a necessity of gaining time for the
completion of the measures of defence, and of securing the capital
from an assault, could not be otherwise than convinced, from the tenor
of the replies made by the Allied Commanders to all its propositions,
that the presence of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> in Paris was the chief obstacle
to any satisfactory arrangement. General <span class="smcap">Becker</span> had been
appointed to attend the latter at Malmaison, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_719" id="Page_719">[Pg 719]</a></span> watch over his safety,
to insure him that respect to which he was so eminently entitled, and
to prevent the ill-disposed from making use of his name for purposes of
excitement and tumult.</p>

<p>Symptoms of a rising among the Buonapartists in Paris had been
manifested on the 28th, a circumstance naturally consequent upon the
re-union in the capital of so many Regiments of the Line, as also of
the Imperial Guard; whose excitement, devotion, and enthusiasm, had
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> placed himself once more at their head, might have
been such as to have brought them into hostile and fierce collision
with the other great Parties of the State; and thus have led to scenes
of the wildest anarchy and confusion within the walls, whilst the Enemy
was thundering at the gates from without.</p>

<p>Hence every effort was employed to induce the ex-Emperor to quit
the capital. The fact of the arrival of the Prussians in front of
St Denis, and the possibility of an attempt being made to carry him
off from Malmaison, were explained to him with much earnestness. He
immediately referred to the map, and on perceiving the practicability
of this <i>coup de main</i>; he adopted precautionary measures of defence.
He also offered to the Government his services in the capacity of
General only; remarking, that he was prepared to march against the
Enemy, and frustrate his bold and hazardous attempt upon the capital.
This proposal was sternly rejected. <span class="smcap">Fouché</span> declared that to
accede to it would be to remove every chance of arrangement with the
Allied Powers; to create fresh troubles and disorders throughout the
country; and, though a temporary success might be gained, to bring down
eventually the concentrated force of the immense European armament upon
the devoted capital.</p>

<p>The Commissioners appointed by the Government to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_720" id="Page_720">[Pg 720]</a></span> communicate its
wishes to <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, no longer hesitated in arranging his
departure. The Minister of the Marine, and Count <span class="smcap">Boulay</span>,
repaired to his residence, and explained to him that the Duke of
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span> and Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> had refused to give
him any safeguard or passport; and that he had now only to take his
immediate departure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> at length yielded to what he considered to be his
destiny; and the preparations for travelling having been completed, he
entered his carriage about five o'clock in the afternoon of the 29th,
accompanied by Generals <span class="smcap">Bertrand, Gourgaud</span>, and other devoted
friends, and took the road to Rochefort: whither two Frigates had been
ordered for the embarkation of himself and suite for America.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> narrowly escaped falling into the hands of the
Prussians, whilst at Malmaison. <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, hearing that he was
living there in retirement, had despatched Major <span class="smcap">Colomb</span>,
on the 28th, with the 8th Hussars and two Battalions of Infantry to
secure the Bridge of Chatou, lower down the Seine, leading directly to
the house. Fortunately, however, for <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>; the Prince of
<span class="smcap">Eckmühl</span>, when he ascertained that the Prussians were nearing
the capital, had desired General <span class="smcap">Becker</span> to cause this Bridge
to be destroyed. Hence Major <span class="smcap">Colomb</span> was much disappointed
at finding there was no passage at this point, which in fact was
not more than eight hundred yards distant from the Palace in which
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> was yet remaining at the time of the arrival of the
Prussians.</p>

<p>On the 29th, the new Commissioners appointed by the French Government
waited upon the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> at Estrée, for the
purpose of negotiating a Suspension of Hostilities. In the course of
the discussion which took place on this occasion, the Duke declared
that he had nothing to add to the communication he had made to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_721" id="Page_721">[Pg 721]</a></span>
former Commissioners; that he could not but consider the Abdication
as a deception; and would not feel himself justified in suspending
his operations on such a pretext, which was by no means calculated to
fulfil the object the Allies had in view. He explained that, besides
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, there were his adherents, who were the declared
Enemies of the Allies; and stated that before he could agree to any
Suspension he "must see some steps taken to re-establish a Government
in France which should afford the Allies some chance of peace."</p>

<p>Upon this point his Grace was pressed to give some explanation as to
what would satisfy the Allies.</p>

<p>He replied that he had no authority from his own Government, much less
from the Allies, to enter upon the subject; and that all he could do
was to give them his private opinion, which he should certainly urge
upon the Allies with all the influence he might be supposed to possess,
unless otherwise instructed by his own Government.</p>

<p>This opinion was a remarkable illustration of the sound judgment,
straightforward policy, and unerring foresight which are so
pre-eminently characteristic of the career of this great man.
Subsequent events proved its correctness to the letter. It was in
strict accordance with the design traced out and enforced by the united
diplomacy of Europe. It is best expressed in the Duke's own words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I then told them that I conceived the best security for Europe
was the Restoration of the King, and that the establishment of any
other Government than the King's in France must inevitably lead to
new and endless Wars; that <span class="smcap">Buonaparte</span> and the Army having
overturned the King's Government, the natural and simple measure,
after <span class="smcap">Buonaparte</span> was prisoner or out of the way and the Army
defeated, was to recall the King to his authority: and that it was a
much more dignified proceeding to recall him without Conditions, and
to trust to the energy of their Constitutions for any Reforms they
wished to make either in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_722" id="Page_722">[Pg 722]</a></span> the Government or the Constitution, than now
to make Conditions with their Sovereign; and that, above all, it was
important that they should recall the King without loss of time, as it
would not then appear that the measure had been forced upon them by
the Allies.</p>

<p>"The Commissioners professed, individually and collectively, their
earnest desire to see the King restored in the manner I had mentioned,
which they said was likewise the desire of the Provisional Government.
&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; was, however, of opinion that the two Chambers could not
be brought to recall the King without Conditions: and he mentioned,
as those upon which they would probably insist, and upon which it
was desirable the King should give way; the responsibility of the
Administration, and the alteration of the Constitution so far as that
the Initiative in making the Laws should be vested in the Assemblies
and not in the King.</p>

<p>"I told them regarding the first point, that I had every reason to
believe that the King had determined to form a Ministry which should
be individually and collectively responsible for all the acts of the
Government; and that I did not doubt that His Majesty would not oppose
himself to the wishes of the French people, if it was desired that the
Initiative in framing the Laws should be invested in the Assemblies:
that, however, I had no authority to speak on this subject; and
recommended to them not to look after little points of difference, and
if they really wished to restore the Government of their King, to do
it at once and without any Conditions.</p>

<p>"In the course of this conversation they stated that the Assemblies
had proclaimed <span class="smcap">Napoleon II.</span> as Emperor only to conciliate the
Officers and Soldiers of the Army; who had come into Paris in such
numbers after the Battle, that they had been apprehensive of a Civil
War in Paris if this measure had not been adopted.</p>

<p>"While we were discussing the Conditions to be proposed to the
King; and the evils and inconveniences which the mode of making the
Laws and the want of Responsibility and Power in the Ministers, had
occasioned; I received from Sir <span class="smcap">Charles Stuart</span>, the King's
Declaration of the 28th, countersigned by <span class="smcap">M. de Talleyrand</span>:
which I immediately communicated to the French Commissioners, and
pointed out to them the King's promise to make the alteration in his
Administration which they had proposed to be made in the Constitution.</p>

<p>"They objected to certain paragraphs in the Declaration referable to
the exclusion of certain persons from the King's presence, to the
intention announced to punish some of those concerned in the plot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_723" id="Page_723">[Pg 723]</a></span>
which had brought back <span class="smcap">Buonaparte</span>, and to that of calling
together the old Houses of Legislature; Upon which, at their desire, I
wrote to <span class="smcap">M. de Talleyrand</span>, a letter, of which Sir <span class="smcap">Charles
Stuart</span> will probably have sent to England a copy, which I
communicated to the Commissioners before I sent it.</p>

<p>"I then told them I could not talk more upon the Suspension of our
Operations, which they urged in the most earnest manner in order to
give them time to take their measures to recall the King, until I
should see Marshal <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>; to whose Head Quarters I promised
to go that evening.</p>

<p>"Before I set off, the Commissioners asked me Whether the appointment
of a Regency to conduct the affairs of the Government in the name of
<span class="smcap">Napoleon II.</span> was likely to satisfy the Allies, and would
be such an arrangement as would induce me to stop my operations? I
answered, Certainly not; that I conceived the Allies, after their
Declaration, would never treat with <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> or any of his
Family; that the appointment of <span class="smcap">Napoleon II.</span> was to be
attributed to <span class="smcap">Napoleon I.</span>, and the acknowledgment of him
to the desire to conciliate the Army; and that I should not stop my
operations in consequence of such an arrangement.</p>

<p>"They then asked me What would be the case if any other Prince of a
Royal House were called to the Throne of France? To which I said It
was impossible for me to answer such loose questions; that, as an
individual, I had made them acquainted with my opinion of what it was
best for them to do, and it rested with them either to follow this
opinion or not.</p>

<p>"One of the Commissioners, before I went away, took occasion to tell
me That he wished I had given a more positive answer to this last
question; and I determined to take another opportunity of doing so
before the Commissioners should report this conversation to Paris.</p>

<p>"I left them at Etrées, and went to the Head Quarters at Le Plessis,
to give the Orders for the movement of the troops in the morning, and
I overtook them again in the night at Louvres. I then told them I had
considered their last question since I had last seen them, and that
I felt no objection to give them my opinion on it as an individual:
That, in my opinion, Europe had no hope of peace if any person
excepting the King were called to the Throne of France; that any
person so called must be considered an Usurper, whatever his rank and
quality; that he must act as an Usurper, and must endeavour to turn
the attention of the country from the defects of his title towards
War and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_724" id="Page_724">[Pg 724]</a></span> Foreign Conquests; that the Powers of Europe must, in such a
case, guard themselves against this evil, and that I could only assure
them that, unless otherwise ordered by my Government, I would exert
any influence I might possess over the Allied Sovereigns to induce
them to insist upon Securities for the preservation of peace, besides
the Treaty itself, if such an arrangement as they had stated were
adopted.</p>

<p>"The Commissioners replied that they perfectly understood me, and some
of them added&mdash;<i>Et vous avez raison</i>."</p></blockquote>

<p class="drop">PRINCE BLÜCHER had satisfied himself, by means of the
reconnaissances made during the 29th, that very considerable pains had
been taken by the Enemy to oppose a serious obstruction to the farther
advance of troops marching against the north side of Paris.</p>

<p>He was now desirous of ascertaining Whether the disposition and spirit
of the Enemy's troops were at all commensurate with the extent of
the Works which he saw before him: and, with this view, he directed
<span class="smcap">Bülow</span> to make an attack, in the night of the 29th, with
part of his <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, upon Aubervilliers. He also desired
<span class="smcap">Zieten</span> to support this attack, by raising as much alarm as
possible in the Villages of Bondy and Pontin.</p>

<p>Before the attack commenced, <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> was joined by
<span class="smcap">Wellington</span> in person, who communicated to him the Proposals
which had been made by the French Commissioners. Being already
engaged in an important operation, he could not consent to suspend
hostilities; and the two Commanders agreed in opinion that, as long
as <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> remained in Paris, they could not arrest their
operations without insisting upon his being delivered up to them.
Accordingly, the Duke wrote a letter immediately to the Commissioners
to this effect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blücher</span> confided the attack upon Aubervilliers to General
<span class="smcap">Sydow</span>, with the Thirteenth Brigade (nine Battalions), together
with one Battalion of the Fourteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_726" id="Page_726">[Pg 726]</a></span> Brigade, and two Regiments of
Cavalry. The remainder of the Fourth <i>Corps d'Armée</i> was held under
arms, in readiness to follow up any acquired advantage. Four Battalions
advanced in Column, under Colonel <span class="smcap">Lettow</span>, supported by the
remaining five Battalions. The arrangements, being made during the
night, occupied some little time, so that twilight had set in when the
attack commenced. Colonel <span class="smcap">Lettow</span> penetrated the extensive
Village on three sides, forced the barriers, and carried every thing
before him with the bayonet. The place had been occupied by one
thousand of the Enemy's best troops; of whom two hundred were made
prisoners, and the remainder pursued as far as the Canal of St Denis.</p>

<p>General <span class="smcap">Sydow</span>, accompanied by Major <span class="smcap">Lützow</span> of the
Staff, immediately made a reconnaissance of the Canal; and soon
discovered that its opposite bank was lined with Infantry in great
force, and that the different points of passage were defended by
Batteries. Nevertheless he made the attempt to advance; but the troops
were received with a vigorous fire of both artillery and musketry;
and it soon became evident, that the Enemy's fortified position
could not be taken except at a great sacrifice of both time and men.
<span class="smcap">Sydow</span>, therefore, limited his operations to the occupation of
the captured Village.</p>

<p>A simultaneous advance towards the Canal was made, on the left of
Aubervilliers, by the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Pomeranian Landwehr, and
the 10th Regiment of Hussars; which maintained the communication with
the First Corps. A sharp <i>tiraillade</i> took place, which terminated in
the withdrawal of these troops to their former position.</p>

<p>By means of this reconnaissance it was made sufficiently manifest
that the line of the Canal of St Denis could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_727" id="Page_727">[Pg 727]</a></span> be carried without
a serious assault, preluded by a heavy cannonade. It then became a
question with the Allied Commanders, who had thus, most fortunately,
the opportunity of concerting measures in person, Whether it would
not be advisable to endeavour to turn the Enemy's strongly fortified
lines of St Denis and Montmartre, by masking those lines with one Army,
whilst the other should move off to the right, and cross to the left
bank of the Seine, lower down the stream.</p>

<p>Although this movement would have the effect of extending and dividing
the Allied forces, and consequently of augmenting the chances of
success on the part of the Enemy: should the latter possess the
disposition and the means, not only of acting determinedly on the
defensive, but also of assuming the offensive, accordingly as
circumstances might favour the attempt; still any defeat of this kind
was fully counterbalanced by the advantages which the plan presented.
It cut off the entire communication with Normandy, from which Paris
derived its chief supplies; whilst the approach of the Bavarian Army
towards the opposite side was gradually limiting the resources of the
capital in that quarter. It enabled the Commanders to present their
forces simultaneously at different points: and thus, by continuing that
display of vigour which had characterised their advance, they were far
more likely to impose upon the <i>morale</i> of both the defeated Army and
the citizens, than by limiting their combined operations to the attack
of the stronghold presented by the lines of St Denis; for to do this,
would, in all probability, require time, and it was evident from the
repeated Proposals made by the French Government for a Suspension of
Hostilities, that time was their great object, whether for the purpose
of facilitating the collection and organisation of their resources,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_728" id="Page_728">[Pg 728]</a></span> or
in the hope of obtaining more favourable terms from the Allies.</p>

<p>It had also been tolerably well ascertained that, although fortified
works had been thrown up on the right bank of the Seine, the defence of
the left bank had been comparatively neglected. A further inducement
towards the adoption of this plan arose from a Report which was now
received from Major <span class="smcap">Colomb</span>, stating that although he had found
the Bridge of Chatou, leading to Malmaison, destroyed: he had hastened
to that of St Germain, on hearing that it had not been injured; and
succeeded in gaining possession of it at the very moment the French
were on the point of effecting its destruction. The Bridge of Maisons,
still lower down the stream, was also taken and occupied.</p>

<p>No time was lost by the Prussian Commander in taking advantage of the
captured Bridges across the Seine.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Sohr</span> received an Order that night to move,
with his Cavalry Brigade (the Brandenburg and Pomeranian Hussars),
from the vicinity of Louvres, and to regulate his march so that he
might cross the Seine at St Germain on the following morning. Thence
he was to proceed so as to appear, with his Brigade, on the 1st of
July, upon the Orleans road from Paris; where he was to interrupt this
communication, and increase the confusion already produced in that
quarter by the fugitives from the capital. Altogether, he was to act
independently and discretionally; and, as far as practicable, to impede
the supplies of provisions from the Western and Southern Provinces.</p>

<p>It was arranged that the Prussian Army should move to its right for the
purpose of crossing the Seine; and, in order to mask the operation as
much as possible, the Advanced Posts of the First and Fourth <span class="smcap">Corps
d'Armée</span> were to remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_729" id="Page_729">[Pg 729]</a></span> in their present position until the
arrival of the Anglo-Allied Army, which was expected to take place on
the evening of the 30th.</p>

<p>The Third Corps was directed to resume, at five o'clock in the morning
of the 30th, its march upon Gonesse; and thence to proceed to St
Germain: but in such a manner as to conceal its movements by means of
the valley of Montmorency, and not to reach the more open ground about
Argenteuil until darkness should have completely set in. From the
latter point it would then complete its march to St Germain.</p>

<p>The First Corps was ordered to break up from its bivouac at ten
o'clock in the evening, and march southward of Gonesse by Montmorency,
Franconville, Cormeilles, and Maisons, at which latter point it was to
cross the Seine, and immediately open a communication with the Third
Corps.</p>

<p>The Fourth <span class="smcap">Corps d'Armée</span> was directed to move, at daybreak of
the 1st of July, by the right of St Denis, and to bombard this place
during its march to Argenteuil; in which direction it was to effect
a junction with the First and Third Corps. The Advanced Posts of the
First and Fourth Corps were to remain until relieved by the British
troops; and then, in like manner, to follow the rest of the Army.</p>

<p>These movements were punctually directed in the manner described.</p>

<p>As the First and Third <i>Corps d'Armée</i> moved off to the right, Count
<span class="smcap">Bülow</span> considered it necessary to strengthen the Outposts
of the Fourth Corps, so as to be prepared to meet the Enemy should
the latter debouch from St Denis. He therefore ordered Colonel
<span class="smcap">Hiller</span> to take post in observation of this point, with six
Battalions, a Regiment of Cavalry, half of a six pounder Battery, and
two pieces of Horse Artillery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_730" id="Page_730">[Pg 730]</a></span></p>

<p>About three o'clock in the afternoon, the Prussian Outposts reported
that French Columns were advancing from St Denis, and that the Vedettes
were already driven in. Colonel <span class="smcap">Hiller</span> immediately pushed
forward the Sharpshooters of two Battalions, as also two Squadrons
of Cavalry, with two pieces of Horse Artillery. At the same time,
the troops at Stains got under arms, and were prepared to support. A
very brisk <i>tiraillade</i> ensued, although there was no cover for the
Skirmishers on the plain, except the trees along the great road and the
high corn, which served to conceal their approach. The Enemy had also
sent Detachments towards Epinay and Pierrefitte; but at these points,
as also in advance of Stains, the French were compelled to give way and
to retire, without having succeeded in their object of forcing back the
Prussian Outposts.</p>

<p>The main body of the Fourth <i>Corps d'Armée</i> remained, during the 30th,
in its position at Le Bourget; its Advanced Guard, under General
<span class="smcap">Sydow</span>, was detached to the right, towards Argenteuil, to
communicate with the Third <i>Corps d'Armée</i>. As the former was to move
off on the following morning, it became necessary to hold the Outposts
strictly on the defensive. Aubervilliers was the most open to attack.
Two Companies were posted at the outlets, towards the French side;
and in rear of these, two other Companies were formed in support.
Still further to the rear was the main position; on which these
troops, if overpowered, were to fall back. It lay along the Villages
of Chantourterelle, Courneuve, and Merville, connected together by a
water course lined with bushes, and consisting of separate Country
Houses and Châteaux, mostly within walls, which had been loopholed for
<i>Tirailleurs</i>. Six Battalions, chiefly extended in skirmishing order,
were considered sufficient to occupy the whole of this line, as far as
the high road from Le<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_731" id="Page_731">[Pg 731]</a></span> Bourget. Partial skirmishing, at a distance,
was kept up; though, on the side of the Prussians, it was more for the
purpose of diverting the attention of the Enemy, and concealing from
him the general movement to the right. Bivouac fires were maintained
during the night on the ground vacated by the different Corps, in order
to deceive the Enemy by their apparent indication of the continued
presence of the Prussian Army in front of the lines of St Denis.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On this day, the Advanced Guard of the Anglo-Allied Army
(<span class="smcap">Vivian</span>'s Hussar Brigade) reached Vauderlan. The British
Cavalry moved to Louvres.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Estorff</span>'s Cavalry, attached to the Second Corps, crossed the
Oise at Creil, and proceeded by Chantilly to Luzarches. The Infantry of
this Corps marched from Clermont to Chantilly.</p>

<p>The First Corps moved from its camp near St Martin Longeau, crossed
the Oise at Pont St Maxence, and advanced until the head of the Column
reached La Capelle, and its rear rested upon Senlis.</p>

<p>The Reserve moved from its camp, near Gournay, by Pont St Maxence, the
head of the Column reaching Fleurines on the road to Senlis, and the
rear resting upon Pont St Maxence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following were the positions of the respective Armies on the
evening of the 30th:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The First Prussian <i>Corps d' Armée</i> commenced its march, at half past
ten o'clock in the evening, from Blancmesnil and Aulnay towards St
Germain, passing, during the night, through Gonesse, Montmorency, and
Le Mesnil, to Carrière au Mont, near St Germain&mdash;leaving its Outposts
in the position they had hitherto occupied.</p>

<p>The Third <i>Corps d'Armée</i> marched, during the night, from Dammartin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_732" id="Page_732">[Pg 732]</a></span>
to St Germain, by Gonesse and Argenteuil; at which latter place,
however, its Reserve Cavalry was halted.</p>

<p>The Fourth <i>Corps d'Armée</i> remained in its position at Le Bourget,
to cover the march of the rest of the Army. Its Outposts continued
at Stains, St Denis, and Aubervilliers. Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">von
Sohr</span>, with the Brandenburg and Pomeranian Hussars, crossed the
Seine at St Germain, and was advancing towards Versailles.</p>

<p>Major <span class="smcap">von Colomb</span>, with the 8th Hussars, occupied the Bridge
of St Germain.</p>

<p>The Head Quarters of Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> continued at Gonesse.</p>

<p>The Advanced Guard of the Anglo-Allied Army was at Vauderlan.</p>

<p>The British Cavalry was encamped on the plain about Louvres.</p>

<p>The Hanoverian Cavalry was at Luzarches.</p>

<p>The Second and Fourth Divisions, and the Nassau troops, were upon the
high road between La Capelle and Senlis.</p>

<p>The Fifth and Sixth Divisions, the Brunswick troops, and the Reserve
Artillery, were upon the high road between Fleurines and Pont St
Maxence.</p>

<p>The Pontoon Train and Hawser Bridges were at Senlis.</p>

<p>The Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Head Quarters were at Louvres.</p>

<p>The French Army remained within the lines of Paris.</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Since the departure of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, both the Army and the
citizens looked upon the Parliament as the sole directing power; and,
in full reliance upon its integrity, appeared willingly submissive to
its dictates. <span class="smcap">Fouché</span>, who had been in secret communication
with the Allies, decided upon exercising, in accordance with their
views, the great influence he had succeeded in acquiring over a very
considerable portion of the Deputies. It was mainly by means of this
influence that he contrived to remove the principal obstacle in the way
of all negotiation&mdash;the presence of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>. His next step
was to prepare the Chamber for the return to power of the legitimate
Monarch: a measure which he could only hope to accomplish by holding
it forth as the sole alternative to the destruction of Paris by the
vast and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_733" id="Page_733">[Pg 733]</a></span> overwhelming force of the Allied Armies marching towards the
capital from the north and east frontiers; and by combining with it the
adoption of such modifications of the Charter as should satisfy the
desires of the Constitutionalists and the moderately disposed of all
Parties.</p>

<p>Aware that the Army was animated with a spirit of determined resistance
towards the Allies; he plainly saw that, unless conciliated, the
turbulent Buonapartists, with whom its ranks were filled, might
speedily frustrate the accomplishment of his plans by which the
peace of the capital was to be preserved, and ultimately prevent
the attainment of that extended Constitutional Power for which the
Deputies were contending. He, therefore, with his usual adroitness,
addressed himself to its Chief, Marshal <span class="smcap">Davoust</span>, Prince of
<span class="smcap">Eckmühl</span>; and by his skilful exposition of the political
posture of affairs, he succeeded in gaining over the Marshal to his
views. The latter wrote to him on the evening of the 29th, that he had
overcome his prejudices; and had arrived at the conclusion that the
only safe course to be pursued consisted in entering into an Armistice,
and proclaiming <span class="smcap">Louis XVIII</span>.</p>

<p>On the 30th, the Prince, as the Head of the French Army, addressed the
following letter to both <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> and <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-left:45%;">

"Head Quarters, La Villette, June 30, 1815.<br />
</p>

<p>"My <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,</p>

<p>"Your hostile movements continue, although, according to the
Declarations of the Allied Sovereigns, the motives of the War which
they make upon us no longer exist; since the Emperor <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>
has abdicated.</p>

<p>"At the moment when blood is again on the point of flowing, I receive
from Marshal the Duke of <span class="smcap">Albufera</span> a telegraphic despatch, of
which I transmit you a copy. My Lord, I guarantee this Armistice on my
honour. All the reasons you might have had to continue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_734" id="Page_734">[Pg 734]</a></span> hostilities
are destroyed; because you can have no other instruction from your
Government than that which the Austrian Generals had from theirs.</p>

<p>"I make the formal demand to your Excellency of ceasing all
hostilities, and of our proceeding to agree to an Armistice, according
to the decision of Congress. I cannot believe, my Lord, that my
request will be ineffectual; you will take upon yourself a great
responsibility in the eyes of your fellow countrymen.</p>

<p>"No other motive but that of putting an end to the effusion of blood,
and the interests of my country, has dictated this letter.</p>

<p>"If I present myself on the Field of Battle, with the idea of your
talents, I shall carry the conviction of there combating for the most
sacred of causes&mdash;that of the defence and independence of my country;
and, whatever may be the result, I shall merit your esteem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:45%;">
"Accept, &amp;c.,<br />
"<span class="smcap">The Marshal Prince of Eckmühl</span>,<br />
"Minister at War."
</p></blockquote>

<p>To this the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> replied in the following
terms:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-left:45%;">

"Head Quarters, July 1, 1815&mdash;10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Monsieur le Maréchal</span>,</p>

<p>"I have just received your Excellency's letter of the 30th June,
in which your Excellency communicates to me the intelligence you
have received of an Armistice having been concluded by General
<span class="smcap">Frimont</span> with Marshal the Duke of <span class="smcap">Albufera</span>.</p>

<p>"I have already made known, in writing, to the French Commissioners
sent to the Allied Powers, and verbally, to the Commissioners sent to
me, the reasons which have prevented me from suspending my operations;
which reasons, I have cause to believe, are fully adopted by the
Allies of my Sovereign, and of those whose Armies I have the honour of
commanding.</p>

<p>"I have every wish to prevent the further effusion of the blood of
the brave troops under my command; but it must be upon the conditions
which shall secure the re-establishment and the stability of the
General Peace.</p>

<p style="margin-left:45%;">
"I have the honour to be, &amp;c.,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_735" id="Page_735">[Pg 735]</a></span></p>

<p>Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, who entertained a great contempt for
diplomacy, attributing as he did the cause of the renewal of the War
to the ill concocted schemes to which that War had given birth, had
hitherto refrained from either receiving in person, or noticing in
writing, any communication addressed to him by the French authorities.
He applied himself solely to the military solution of the Great Problem
on which depended the Peace of Europe.</p>

<p>Upon this occasion, however, tempted probably by the opportunity which
was offered to him of sharply retorting upon the Marshal, under whose
government of Hamburg the greatest excesses had been committed upon
his countrymen; he was induced to pen the following reply, couched in
his rough native German, as if to evince both his disdain of the usual
diplomatic mode of communication, and his dislike of even the very
language of the country he so thoroughly detested:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-left:45%;">"<i>To the French General <span class="smcap">Davoust</span>.</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:55%;">
"Head Quarters, July 1, 1815.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Marshal</span>,</p>

<p>"It is not conformable to truth that, because <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> has
abdicated the throne, there exists no further motive for War between
the Allied Powers and France. His abdication is conditional; that
is, in favour of his son: but a Decree of the Allied Powers excludes
not only <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, but every member of his Family, from the
Throne.</p>

<p>"If General <span class="smcap">Frimont</span> has considered himself authorised to
conclude an Armistice with your General opposed to him, that is no
motive for us to do the same. We shall pursue our victory. GOD has
given us strength and resolution to do so. Beware, Marshal, of what
you do; and forbear devoting another city to destruction! for you
know what liberties the exasperated soldiers would take, should your
capital be carried by storm. Do you solicit the maledictions of Paris,
in addition to those of Hamburg?</p>

<p>"We shall enter Paris to protect the respectable inhabitants against
the mob, by whom they are threatened with pillage. An Armistice
can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_736" id="Page_736">[Pg 736]</a></span> be made with security nowhere but in Paris. This, our relative
position towards your Nation, be pleased, Marshal, not to mistake!</p>

<p>"Let me finally observe to you, Marshal, if you mean to negotiate with
us, it is matter of surprise that, in defiance of the Law of Nations,
you detain our Officers dispatched with Letters and Orders.</p>

<p>"In the usual form of conventional civility, I have the honour to be,</p>

<p style="margin-left:45%;">
"Marshal,<br />
"Your obedient servant,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Blücher</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whilst thus endeavouring to draw the Allied Generals into negotiation;
<span class="smcap">Fouché</span> and <span class="smcap">Davoust</span> felt the necessity of carrying
out their plans with the greatest caution, and in such a manner as to
prevent any unfavourable construction being put upon their motives by
the Army.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 30th of June, there was an assemblage of General
Officers at the Head Quarters in Villette; at which it was proposed
to send up an Address to the Chamber of Representatives expressive of
the determined spirit of resistance which animated the troops, and of
their hostility to the Bourbons. It was adopted by the majority; and
<span class="smcap">Davoust</span>, though secretly working with <span class="smcap">Fouché</span> for the
Restoration of <span class="smcap">Louis XVIII.</span>, did not hesitate to attach to it
his signature. It was couched in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-left:45%;">

"Camp at Villette, 30th June.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Representatives of the People!</span></p>

<p>"We are in presence of our Enemies. We swear before you and the world
to defend, to our last breath, the cause of our independence and the
national honour.</p>

<p>"It is wished to impose the Bourbons upon us, but these Princes
are rejected by the immense majority of Frenchmen. If their return
could be agreed to, recollect, Representatives, that you would sign
the annihilation of the Army; which for twenty years has been the
Palladium of French honour. There are in War, especially when it has
been long conducted, successes and reverses. In our successes, we
have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_737" id="Page_737">[Pg 737]</a></span> appeared great and generous. If it is wished to humble us in our
reverses, we shall know how to die.</p>

<p>"The Bourbons present no guarantee to the Nation. We received them
with sentiments of the most generous confidence: we forgot all the
calamities they had caused us in their rage to deprive us of our most
sacred rights. Well! what return did they make for this confidence?
They treated us as rebels and as vanquished. Representatives! these
reflections are terrible, because they are true. History will one day
relate what the Bourbons have done to replace themselves on the Throne
of France; it will also narrate the conduct of the Army; of that Army
essentially national; and posterity will judge which best deserved the
esteem of the World.</p>

<p style="margin-left:45%;">
"The Marshal Prince of <span class="smcap">Eckmühl</span>, Minister at War,<br />
"Count <span class="smcap">Pajol</span>, commanding the First Corps of Cavalry,<br />
"Count <span class="smcap">d'Erlon</span>, commanding the Right Wing,<br />
"Count <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>, General in Chief."<br />
(And fifteen other Generals.)<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The Chambers being thus appealed to, felt it incumbent on them to
issue a Proclamation explanatory of the political situation of France;
and of their own intentions under all the critical circumstances in
which it presented itself to their view. This document, cautiously
drawn up by the Constitutionalists who formed the preponderating party
in the State, and strongly marked by the policy which was pursued
throughout by <span class="smcap">Fouché</span>, was framed with great tact. Although it
acknowledged the nomination of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s son to the Empire,
it manifested no hostility to the Bourbons: it expressed a desire
to secure a Monarchical and Representative Government; but, at the
same time, declared that the Head of the Government, whoever he might
be, must enter into a solemn Compact and abide by the Constitutional
Charter.</p>

<p>In short, its general tone was sufficiently independent to secure
for it, if not the approbation, at least the acquiescence, of both
the Liberals and the Buonapartists; whilst, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_738" id="Page_738">[Pg 738]</a></span> other hand, it
significantly indicated the terms upon which a Bourbon might re-ascend
the throne, and rally round him the Friends of Constitutional Order and
Civil Rights. With but few exceptions it admitted of being reconciled
with the Proclamation published on the 28th of June by Louis XVIII. It
ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Frenchmen</span>!</p>

<p>"The Foreign Powers proclaimed, in the face of Europe, that they were
only armed against <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>; and that they wished to respect
our independence, and the right which belongs to every Nation to
choose a Government suitable to its habits and its interests.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> is no longer the Chief of the State. He has
renounced the Throne, and his Abdication has been accepted by your
Representatives. He is removed from us. His son is called to the
Empire by the Constitution of the State. The coalesced Sovereigns are
informed of this; and the War ought to be terminated, if the promises
of Kings have any foundation in truth.</p>

<p>"While Plenipotentiaries have been sent to the Allied Powers to treat
for peace in the name of France; the Generals of two of those Powers
have refused any Suspension of Arms. Their troops have accelerated
their marches under favour of a moment of hesitation and trouble. They
are now at the very gates of the capital, and no communication has
stated for what object the War is continued. Our Plenipotentiaries
will soon declare whether we must renounce Peace. In the mean time,
resistance is not only legitimate, but necessary: and humanity, in
requiring an account of the blood uselessly shed, will not accuse
those brave men who only combat to repel from their houses the
scourges of war, murder, and pillage; and to defend with their lives
the cause of Liberty, and of that Independence the imprescriptible
right of which has been guaranteed to them even by the Manifestoes of
their Enemies.</p>

<p>"Amidst these circumstances, your Representatives cannot forget that
they were not chosen to stipulate for the interests of any individual
Party, but for the whole Nation. Every act of weakness will dishonour
them, and will only tend to endanger the future tranquillity of
France. While the Government is employing all the means in its power
to obtain a solid Peace; or, should that not be obtained without
compromising our honour, to repel the Battalions of Foreigners:
what more advantages to the Nation can be done than to collect and
establish the fundamental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_739" id="Page_739">[Pg 739]</a></span> rules of a Monarchical and Representative
Government, destined to secure to all citizens the free enjoyment of
those sacred rights which sacrifices so numerous and so great have
purchased; and to rally for ever, under the National Colours, that
great body of Frenchmen who have no other interest, and no other wish,
than an honourable repose and a just independence.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile the Chambers conceive that their duty and their dignity
require them to declare that they will never acknowledge, as
legitimate Chief of the State, him who, on ascending the Throne, shall
refuse to acknowledge the Rights of the Nation, and to consecrate them
by a solemn Compact. The Constitutional Charter is drawn up; and if
the force of arms should succeed in temporarily imposing upon us a
Master&mdash;if the destinies of a great Nation are again to be delivered
up to the caprice and arbitrary will of a small number of privileged
persons&mdash;then, in yielding to force, the National Representation will
protest in the face of the whole World against the oppression of the
French People.</p>

<p>"Your Representatives will appeal to the energy of the present and
future generations to renew their claim both to National Independence,
and the Rights of Civil and Religious Liberty. For these Rights they
now appeal to the reason and the justice of all civilized Nations."</p></blockquote>

<p>Notwithstanding the continued endeavours, on the part of the French
Commissioners appointed by the Chambers, to induce the Allied Generals
to enter upon an Armistice; the military operations were not for a
moment interrupted.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 1st of July, <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s <i>Corps d' Armée</i>
(the Fourth) moved off to its right, towards Argenteuil. During the
movement, however; the Enemy, as if at length aware, or desirous of
ascertaining the nature, of <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s operation, attacked the
Village of Aubervilliers in front, from the Canal of St Denis, and
penetrated as far as the Church situated in the centre of the place.
The French were here met by the Prussian Support; and two Battalions
from the main position arriving immediately afterwards, they were
prevented from making any further progress. Nevertheless, a prolonged
<i>tiraillade</i>, as well as a howitzer fire, on the part of the French,
were maintained; during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_740" id="Page_740">[Pg 740]</a></span> which the march of <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Corps
continued in operation, the Fourteenth Brigade being left in support to
the Advanced Posts until the arrival of the Anglo-Allied troops.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the afternoon, the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>'s Army reached Le
Bourget; and took up the position vacated by Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>,
whose Advanced Posts it immediately relieved. Three Companies of
Light Infantry from <span class="smcap">Colville</span>'s Division were thrown into
Aubervilliers. The Prussians who had hitherto been stationed for the
purpose of masking as much as possible the general movement of their
Army to the right, had kept up a desultory fire from that portion of
the Village which was in their possession; abstaining from making any
direct attack, since this might have led to the advance of the French
in great force at the moment the former were no longer supported by the
main Army, and before the Anglo-Allied troops had arrived.</p>

<p>The British Light Companies, mentioned as having been thrown into
Aubervilliers, were under no restraint of this kind; and Lieutenant
Colonel Sir <span class="smcap">Neil Campbell</span>, who commanded them, determined to
push forward, and possess himself, if possible, of the entire Village.
Having first gained two or three of the highest houses, he broke from
the top of these into some that were lower; and thence forcing his way
through the partition walls of others, without much firing, since the
French did not appear disposed to make an obstinate resistance (being
by that time probably aware of the Prussian movement to the right, and
of the arrival of the Anglo-Allied Army), he succeeded in obtaining
possession of one side of a whole street, and of the greater portion of
the Village. The French Officer in command then proposed a truce; which
was accepted, since the Post he occupied lay between the British and a
Battery upon the Canal. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_741" id="Page_741">[Pg 741]</a></span> remaining Outposts were taken up from the
Prussians without any molestation on the part of the Enemy; and the
main Anglo-Allied Army occupied a position, having its Right upon the
Height of Richebourg, and its Left upon the Wood of Bondy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It will be recollected that Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Sohr</span>, of the
Prussian Light Cavalry, was directed to pass the Bridge of St Germain
on the morning of the 30th of June, and to show himself on the Orleans
road upon the 1st of July. Starting at daybreak of the 30th, the
Brigade passed through Montmorency and Argenteuil, towards St Germain;
where it fell in with Major <span class="smcap">Colomb</span>'s Detachment, consisting
of the 8th Hussars and two Battalions of Infantry. It then moved on
about a league further, to Marly, upon the Versailles road; which it
reached at nightfall, and where it bivouacked. On the morning of the
1st of July, Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Sohr</span> resumed his march, and
took the direction of Versailles, which place, however, he did not
reach until noon; much delay having occurred whilst passing through the
intersected ground in that quarter, and in awaiting the Reports from
the Detachments sent out in different directions to gain intelligence
of the Enemy.</p>

<p>This bold and hazardous movement of Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Sohr</span>'s
Brigade, which was acting independently as a Free Corps for the time,
did not escape the Enemy's observation. General <span class="smcap">Excelmans</span>, who
commanded the French Cavalry on the south side of Paris, on receiving
information that two Regiments of Prussian Hussars were advancing by
Marly upon Versailles, resolved to attack them.</p>

<p>For this purpose he proceeded himself with the 5th, 15th, and 20th
Dragoons, and the 6th Hussars, comprising a force of three thousand
men, along the road from Montrouge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_742" id="Page_742">[Pg 742]</a></span> towards Plessis Piquet, against
the front of the Prussian Brigade. At the same time, the Light Cavalry
Division of General <span class="smcap">Piré</span>, together with the 33rd Regiment of
Infantry, consisting of three Battalions, were detached against the
flank and rear of the Prussian Brigade. The 5th and 6th Lancers marched
by the Sèvres road upon Viroflay; the 6th <i>Chasseurs</i> proceeded to
occupy the cross roads connecting Sèvres with the northern portion of
Versailles; the 1st <i>Chasseurs</i> moved by Sèvres towards Rocquencourt,
about three miles from Versailles, on the road to St Germain; in which
direction the 33rd Infantry followed. Both the latter Regiments were
destined to cut off the retreat of the Prussian Cavalry, should it be
driven back by <span class="smcap">Excelmans</span>. An exceedingly well planned ambush
was now laid in and about Rocquencourt, and every precaution taken by
the detaching of small parties on the look out.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Sohr</span>
received intelligence that the Enemy's Cavalry was approaching, and
that his Advanced Guard was attacked. He immediately advanced with both
his Hussar Regiments, and drove back the Enemy upon Villa Coublai, in
the Defile of which Village a sharp engagement ensued. In this attack
the ranks of the Prussian Hussars had become disordered; and, as the
latter retired, they were fallen upon by the 5th and 6th French Lancers
of <span class="smcap">Piré</span>'s Light Cavalry Brigade, before alluded to as having
been posted in ambush. They then fell back upon Versailles, pursued by
the French; who vainly endeavoured to force an entrance into the Town,
at the Gate of which a gallant resistance was made by the Prussians.
The short time that was gained by this resistance sufficed for
collecting the main body of the Brigade on the open space at the outlet
leading to St Germain, towards which point it might have retreated
through the Park; but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_743" id="Page_743">[Pg 743]</a></span> having received information of the advance of
<span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s Corps, and expecting every moment to derive from
it a Support, Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Sohr</span> retired by the more
direct road through Rocquencourt.</p>

<p>About seven o'clock in the evening, at which time the Hussars had
collected their scattered force together, and were on the point of
commencing their further retreat upon St Germain: <span class="smcap">Sohr</span>
received intelligence, upon which he could rely, that he had been
turned by both Cavalry and Infantry; and that his line of retreat had
been intercepted. His decision was instantly formed. He knew his men,
their devotion, and their courage; and resolved upon cutting his way
through the Enemy with the sword.</p>

<p>On quitting Versailles the Prussian Hussars were fired upon by the
National Guard from the Barrier. They had not proceeded far when word
was brought in, that Prussian and English Cavalry were approaching from
the side of St Germain; but they were speedily undeceived. It was the
1st Regiment of French <i>Chasseurs</i>. In the next moment they were formed
for attack, and advanced at a gallop. The <i>Chasseurs</i> came on in the
same style; but they were completely overthrown, and their Commanding
Officer lay stretched upon the ground by a pistol shot. As they were
pursued by the Hussars, a fire was unexpectedly opened upon the latter
by two Companies of the 3rd Battalion of the 33rd French Regiment,
posted behind some hedges, near Le Chesnay; whereupon <span class="smcap">Sohr</span>,
with the greater part of his Hussars, struck into a field road to the
right, in order to turn this Village, which was occupied by the Enemy.
This, however, led them to a bridge, with adjacent houses, occupied
by two more Companies of the above Battalion; from which they also
received a sharp fire. Meeting with this new obstacle, and aware of the
proximity of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_744" id="Page_744">[Pg 744]</a></span> mass of Cavalry under <span class="smcap">Excelmans</span>, in
their rear; the diminished and disordered remnant of the two Prussian
Regiments, about 150 Hussars, rallying upon their Chief, dashed across
a meadow, with a determination to force a passage through the Village
of Le Chesnay. Here the <i>Chasseurs</i> again opposed them, but were once
more overthrown; and the Prussians now followed a road which conducted
them through the Village, but which unfortunately led into a large
court whence there was no other outlet. Not only was their further
progress thus checked, but their whole body was suddenly assailed by a
fire from Infantry, already posted in this quarter; whilst the pursuing
Cavalry prevented every chance of escape. Their situation had become
truly desperate; but their bravery, instead of succumbing, appeared
incited to the highest pitch by the heroic example of Lieutenant
Colonel <span class="smcap">Sohr</span>: who rejected the offer of quarter, and fell,
severely wounded by a pistol shot. Victory favoured the strongest: but
it was a victory gained by immeasurably superior numbers over the dead
and dying of a gallant band of warriors; who fought to the last, and
did all that the most inflexible bravery could accomplish.</p>

<p>The losses incurred by this Brigade during the short Campaign had
already reduced it, previously to this Affair, to between 600 and 700
men: and on the present occasion it suffered a still further loss of
ten Officers, and from 400 to 500 men.</p>

<p>The detaching of these two Regiments so much in advance of the Prussian
general movement to the right; and the Orders given to Lieutenant
Colonel <span class="smcap">Sohr</span>, to cross the Seine on the morning of the 30th
of June, appear a questionable measure. It is true that this Officer
was desired to consider himself as acting independently, and without
reference to the troops that were to follow in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_745" id="Page_745">[Pg 745]</a></span> the same direction;
but then it must be recollected that he had to proceed along a very
considerable portion of the circumference of a circle, from the
centre of which the Enemy could detach superior force along radii far
shorter than the distance between the Prussian Brigade and the main
Army: so that, with a vigilant look out, the French possessed every
facility of cutting off his retreat. His Orders were to interrupt the
communication with Paris by the Orleans road, and to spread alarm
and confusion on that side of the capital: but in issuing them the
effect likely to be produced upon the <i>morale</i> of the citizens could
have alone been contemplated; and, in all probability, it was at the
same time conceived that, as no fortified works had been thrown up on
the south side, the French troops intended to direct their attention
mainly, if not wholly, towards the Armies in front of the northern
portion of the capital. The effect thus sought to be produced might
have been obtained in the case of a weak garrison; but that of Paris,
comprising as it did about 50,000 troops of the Line, besides the
National Guards, was not to be so lightly treated. In carrying into
execution the Order to create alarm and confusion on the south side
of Paris, these two Regiments of Hussars would naturally draw in that
direction the attention of the French Commanders; and thus lead, as
the result proved, not only to the cutting off of so comparatively
weak a force, but also to the posting of a respectable body of troops
at the threatened point, in anticipation of the Enemy's following up
the attack in greater force. Even previously to obtaining the insight
thus afforded into a part of the plan of the Invaders, the movements
of the latter had been more narrowly watched than was supposed: as may
be readily inferred from the fact of <span class="smcap">Excelmans</span> having been
detached, on the 1st, towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_746" id="Page_746">[Pg 746]</a></span> Versailles, with a body of Cavalry;
and of the position at Montrouge having been occupied in considerable
force. All circumstances considered, the preferable course would have
been, to have employed <span class="smcap">Sohr</span>'s Brigade as an Advanced Guard
only; having immediate support from the main Columns in its rear.</p>

<p>It so happened that the Advanced Guard of <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s
Corps, consisting of the Ninth Infantry Brigade, under General
<span class="smcap">Borcke</span>, was on the march from St Germain (which it had left
about seven o'clock in the evening) to take post at Marly; when it
received intelligence of the two Cavalry Regiments, under Lieutenant
Colonel <span class="smcap">Sohr</span>, having been completely defeated. <span class="smcap">Borcke</span>
hastened forward, and it was not long before his Advance became engaged
with the French <i>Tirailleurs</i> proceeding from Versailles. The Enemy was
immediately attacked, and driven back upon Rocquencourt. As darkness
was setting in, <span class="smcap">Borcke</span> drew up his force with caution. He
pushed forward the Fusilier Battalion of the 8th Regiment, supported
by the 1st Battalion of the 30th Regiment; and held the remainder
in Battalion Columns on the right and left of the road. The vigour
of the attack made by the first named Battalion was such that the
Enemy retired in all haste upon the nearest suburb of Paris; whilst
<span class="smcap">Borcke</span> bivouacked at Rocquencourt.</p>

<p>Besides the Cavalry under <span class="smcap">Excelmans</span>, the remains of the Third
and Fourth French <i>Corps d'Armée</i> were detached to the south of Paris;
on which side <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>, who commanded, took up a position,
having his Right upon the Seine, his Left by Montrouge, and his Centre
in rear of Issy. He placed a portion of his troops in the villages of
Vanves and Issy; the houses and walls of which appeared to offer great
advantages for defence. His Advanced Guard occupied Chatillon, Clamord,
Meudon, Sèvres, and St Cloud. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_747" id="Page_747">[Pg 747]</a></span> evening he was joined by the
Imperial Guard, which he posted in support.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following were the positions of the respective Armies on the
evening of the 1st of July:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Second Corps of the Anglo-Allied Army, under Lord <span class="smcap">Hill</span>,
comprising the Second and Fourth Divisions, the Nassau troops, and
<span class="smcap">Estorff</span>'s Hanoverian Cavalry Brigade, was in the position
previously occupied by the Fourth Prussian Corps; having its Right
upon the great road about Pierrefitte, its Left upon the great road
of Senlis, and its Advanced Posts at Aubervilliers and in front of St
Denis.</p>

<p>The First Corps, under Sir <span class="smcap">John Byng</span>, comprising the First
and Third Divisions, and the Dutch-Belgian troops, were in the
position previously occupied by the First Prussian Corps; having its
Right upon the great road behind Le Bourget; its Left upon the Forest
of Bondy, and its Advanced Posts along the Ourcq Canal.</p>

<p>The Reserve, under Sir <span class="smcap">James Kempt</span>, was encamped between
Louvres and Vauderlan.</p>

<p>The Cavalry was encamped and cantoned about the villages of
Groussainville, Vauderlan, and Roissy.</p>

<p>The Pontoon Train and the Hawser Bridges were at Sarcelles, on the
Chantilly road to Paris.</p>

<p>The Head Quarters of the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> were at Gonesse.</p>

<p>The First Prussian <i>Corps d'Armée</i> was encamped between the villages
of Le Mesnil and Carrière au Mont, on the left bank of the Seine, not
far from St Germain.</p>

<p>The Third Corps was also on the left bank of the Seine, in the valley,
and near St Germain. Its Advanced Guard (the Ninth Brigade) was at
Rocquencourt.</p>

<p>The Fourth Corps was upon the march to St Germain.</p>

<p>Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s Head Quarters were at St Germain.</p>

<p>The Third and Fourth French <i>Corps d'Armée</i> and the Imperial Guard
were on the south side of Paris, their Right upon the Seine, their
Left by Montrouge; with the Advanced Guard at Chatillon, Clamord,
Meudon, Sèvres, and St Cloud.</p>

<p>The remainder of the French Army continued within the capital.</p>

<p>The Prince of <span class="smcap">Eckmühl</span>'s Head Quarters were at Villette.</p></blockquote>

<p>At daybreak of the 2nd of July, <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> put the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_748" id="Page_748">[Pg 748]</a></span>
Prussian Army in motion towards the south side of Paris, where he
purposed taking possession of the advantageous position comprising
the Heights of Meudon and Chatillon, and their immediate vicinity.
<span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s Advanced Guard (the Ninth Brigade) immediately
proceeded to occupy Versailles. The Corps itself halted two hours at
Rocquencourt to wait for the arrival of <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Corps. As
the latter Corps advanced, it threw out a Detachment to its left,
consisting of the 1st Battalion of the 1st West Prussian Regiment, two
pieces of Horse Artillery, and a Squadron of Cavalry, under Captain
<span class="smcap">Krensky</span>: who was directed to proceed by Malmaison towards St
Cloud, communicating with Major <span class="smcap">Colomb</span>, who had already been
detached, with the force before mentioned as being under his command,
towards the Bridge of Neuilly; and to keep a look out to the left of
the direct road to Paris. On <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Advanced Guard reaching
Ville d'Avray, whence it drove off a French Picquet, information was
obtained that the Enemy was restoring the Bridge of St Cloud, which he
had previously destroyed; and that he occupied the Bois de Boulogne in
considerable force. The Third Brigade was therefore ordered to proceed
by its left towards St Cloud, and to oppose any movement which might be
attempted against that Flank.</p>

<p>It was three o'clock in the afternoon when <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s First
Brigade, under <span class="smcap">Steinmetz</span>, reached Sèvres. Here the French
were strongly posted, occupying the place itself, the Heights of
Bellevue; and having their Light Troops well disposed amongst the
adjacent gardens and vineyards. The First Prussian Brigade was followed
in support by the Second and Fourth Brigades; and, notwithstanding
the very gallant defence that was made, these troops succeeded in
forcing the French to abandon their stronghold, and fall back upon
Moulineau. Here the French made another stand; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_749" id="Page_749">[Pg 749]</a></span> were again defeated
by <span class="smcap">Steinmetz</span>, who had closely pursued them. Whilst the First
Brigade was thus gaining ground; the Second, together with the Reserve
Artillery, advanced towards the Heights of Meudon. The Reserve Cavalry
of the Corps followed the First Brigade, in support. The Fourth Brigade
occupied Sèvres. Major General <span class="smcap">Jagow</span>, who had been detached
to the left with the Third Brigade, having ascertained that the Enemy
was not likely to undertake any movement from the Bois de Boulogne,
and that Captain <span class="smcap">Krensky</span>'s Detachment was on the look out in
that direction, proceeded to rejoin the Corps; and on reaching Sèvres,
towards evening, he was directed by <span class="smcap">Zieten</span> to take up a
position with his Brigade to the right, on the Heights of Meudon.</p>

<p>In the evening, the French, after having reformed, and collected
their defeated force at Issy, made an attempt to regain possession
of Moulineau; but the attack failed, and they were driven back upon
Issy. Here they were reinforced: fifteen Battalions were posted in
and about Issy, supported by numerous guns and Cavalry: their Light
Infantry occupying the vineyards in front of the Village. About half
past ten o'clock in the night, however, the Prussians, who kept a
sharp look out, heard these troops marching off; and perceived that
their departure was conducted in rather a disorderly manner. Instant
advantage was taken of this circumstance, and a part of the First
and Second Prussian Brigades attacked the French; who fled back upon
the suburb of Vaugirard in such confusion that Paris might have been
entered at this moment, if more force had been at hand.</p>

<p>During the night, <span class="smcap">Zieten</span> posted his Corps in the following
manner:&mdash;His Right upon the Height of Clamord, his Centre upon that of
Meudon, and his Left in Moulineau;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_750" id="Page_750">[Pg 750]</a></span> Sèvres still occupied; the Advanced
Guard in Issy, in the rear of which Village was the Reserve Cavalry in
support.</p>

<p>Whilst <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Corps had been thus successfully effecting its
movement against the south side of the capital; <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span>'s,
which formed the Right Column, proceeded towards Plessis Piquet, and
pushed forward its Advanced Guard to the Heights of Chatillon, which
it reached late in the evening. <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Corps, acting as a
Reserve, occupied Versailles and its vicinity during the night.</p>

<p>During the whole of this day, the troops of the Anglo-Allied Army
continued in position in front of the fortified lines on the north
side of Paris. The Duke having established a Bridge at Argenteuil,
Detachments were sent across the Seine: and these, having secured the
Villages of Asnières, Courbevoie, and Suresnes on the left bank of the
Seine, opened a communication with the Prussians.</p>

<p>The Allied Commanders had thus succeeded in shutting up the French
forces within their lines. <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> was perfectly prepared
to attack the north side of Paris, if circumstances should render
such a step necessary; or if a favourable opportunity should present
itself: whilst <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, having secured a strong position in
front of the south side, which was mostly open and defenceless, was
equally ready to storm the capital with his collected force. The effect
of this well conceived and successfully executed plan of operation
was to divide the Enemy's attention between two opposite points of
the town. Should he attempt to assail the one Army with his principal
force, he would immediately find himself attacked by the other Army;
without possessing the means wherewith to carry on the contest with
both simultaneously. On the other hand, should a general and formidable
assault be made by those Armies, on the opposite points, at the same
time; the necessary division of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_751" id="Page_751">[Pg 751]</a></span> forces, in arranging his plan of
defence, would render his situation still more desperate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Provisional Government, fully alive to this state of things,
and duly aware of the approach of the Bavarian, Russian, and
Austrian Armies, clearly saw the inutility of further resistance
to the Allies, and instructed the Commissioners to wait upon the
Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, and report to his Grace the fact of
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> having quitted Paris on the 29th to embark for the
United States, and to press the point of a Suspension of Hostilities.</p>

<p>To this representation the Duke replied that the great obstacle to
the Armistice having thus been removed, there remained only the
question as to the terms; which he thought should be the halting of
the Anglo-Allied and Prussian Armies in their present positions, the
withdrawal of the French Army from Paris across the Loire, and the
placing of the capital in the keeping of the National Guards until the
King should order otherwise. He offered, if they agreed to these terms,
to endeavour to prevail on Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> to halt his troops,
and send an Officer to settle the details; but, at the same time, he
told them distinctly that he would not consent to suspend hostilities
so long as a French soldier remained in Paris.</p>

<p>Having received this explicit declaration on the part of his Grace, the
Commissioners withdrew.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following were the positions of the respective Armies during the
night of the 2nd of July:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The troops of the Anglo-Allied Army continued in position in front of
the lines of St Denis. Detachments were at Asnières, Courbevoie, and
Suresnes, on the left hank of the Seine.</p>

<p>The First Prussian <i>Corps d'Armée</i> had its Right on the Height of
Clamard, its Centre on that of Meudon, its Left at Moulineau, and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_752" id="Page_752">[Pg 752]</a></span>
Advanced Guard at Issy; in rear of which point was the Reserve Cavalry
of the Corps.</p>

<p>Of the Third Corps, the Ninth Brigade was at Chatillon, the Tenth and
Eleventh Brigades were in front of Vélizy, the Twelfth Brigade was at
Chatenay and Sceaux. The Reserve Cavalry of the Corps bivouacked about
Plessis Piquet.</p>

<p>Of the Fourth Corps, the Sixteenth Brigade was at Montreail, in
advance of Versailles; the Thirteenth Brigade bivouacked near
Viroflay; the Fourteenth Brigade bivouacked at Le Chesnay Bel Air, not
far from Rocquencourt. The Reserve Cavalry of the Corps was partly in
front of Versailles, and partly on the left of Montreail.</p>

<p>The troops composing the Right Wing of the French Army occupied the
lines on the right bank of the Seine, whence they were watching the
British. Some troops were posted in the Bois de Boulogne, and several
Posts were established along both banks of the river.</p>

<p>The Left Wing extended from the Seine as far as the Orleans road. It
held Vaugirard strongly occupied, the main body was posted between the
Barrières de l'Ecole Militaire and de l'Enfer.</p></blockquote>

<p>At three o'clock on the morning of the 3rd of July, <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>
advanced in two Columns from Vaugirard to the attack of Issy. Between
Vaugirard and the Seine, he had a considerable force of Cavalry, the
front of which was flanked by a Battery advantageously posted near
Auteuil on the right bank of the river. The action commenced with a
brisk cannonade: the French having brought twenty pieces of cannon
against the front of the Village, which was then vigorously assailed
by his Infantry. The Prussians had constructed some barricades, and
other defences, during the night; but these did not protect them from
the sharp fire of case shot which was poured upon them by the French
Batteries, the guns of which enfiladed the streets. The 12th and 24th
Prussian Regiments, and the 2nd Westphalian Landwehr, supported by a
half Battery of twelve pounders, fought with great bravery. There was
much loss on both sides. At length the French withdrew; but only to
advance again, considerably reinforced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_753" id="Page_753">[Pg 753]</a></span></p>

<p>The Second Prussian Brigade was immediately ordered to join the
First, and the whole of the troops of the First Corps stood to their
arms. <span class="smcap">Zieten</span> sent a request to Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> for
the support of two Brigades of <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Corps; and, at the
same time, begged <span class="smcap">Thielemann</span> to advance (in conformity with
instructions conveyed to him from Head Quarters) from Chatillon, and
threaten the Enemy's Left Flank.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the French renewed their attack upon Issy; which,
however, again proved unsuccessful. This was followed by a heavy
cannonade and by further assaults, without any decided advantage having
been gained over the defenders. The French did not appear disposed
to venture upon a more general attack, which would have offered them
a much greater chance of forcing back the Prussian Advanced Guard;
probably considering that, if unsuccessful, it might end in the suburbs
of Paris being easily carried by storm: and hence, after four hours'
continued but fruitless attempts upon <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Advanced
Position, they fell back upon Paris; the Prussian <i>Tirailleurs</i>
following them until they came within a very short distance of the
Barriers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At a Council of War, which had been held during the previous night
in Paris, it was decided that the defence of the capital was not
practicable against the Allied Armies. Nevertheless, <span class="smcap">Davoust</span>
was desirous that another attempt should be made on the Prussian Army:
but now that this had failed in the manner described, that the two
Allied Armies were in full communication with each other, and that a
British Corps was likewise moving upon the left of the Seine towards
Neuilly, a Capitulation was determined upon.</p>

<p>Accordingly, at seven o'clock in the morning, the fire on the part of
the French suddenly ceased; and General <span class="smcap">Revest</span> was deputed
to pass over to <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Corps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_754" id="Page_754">[Pg 754]</a></span> which of all the Allied
troops was the nearest to the capital, for the purpose of offering a
Capitulation, and requesting an immediate Armistice. <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>,
however, required from Marshal <span class="smcap">Davoust</span>, the Commander in Chief
of the French Army, a negotiator possessing greater powers, before
he would finally agree to a Suspension of Hostilities; and indicated
the Palace of St Cloud as the place where the negotiations should be
carried on, to which point he then removed his Head Quarters.</p>

<p>During the contest at Issy, the Detachments on the left of the First
Prussian Corps, under Captain <span class="smcap">Krensky</span>, were engaged rather
sharply with the Enemy between St Cloud and Neuilly; which ended in
the French being driven back upon the Bridge at the latter place,
towards which point also a body of British troops was advancing. Thus
<span class="smcap">Zieten</span>'s Corps, the same that had opened the Campaign with the
actions along the Sambre, had the honour of closing it with those at
Issy and Neuilly on the Seine.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Officers, furnished with full powers by their respective Chiefs, soon
met at St Cloud; whither the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> had already
repaired in person to join Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>; and the result of
their deliberations was the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>On the 4th, the French Army, commanded by Marshal <span class="smcap">Davoust</span>,
quitted Paris; and proceeded on its march to the Loire: and the
Anglo-Allied troops occupied St Denis, St Ouen, Clichy, and Neuilly.
On the 5th, the latter took possession of Montmartre. On the 6th,
they occupied the Barriers of Paris, upon the right of the Seine; and
the Prussians those upon the left bank. On the 7th, the two Allied
Armies entered Paris: the Chamber of Peers, having received from
the Provisional Government a notification of the course of events,
terminated its sittings; the Chamber of Deputies protested, but in
vain. Their President (<span class="smcap">Lanjuinais</span>) quitted his Chair; and on
the following day, the doors were closed, and the approaches guarded by
foreign troops.</p>

<p>On the 8th, the French King, <span class="smcap">Louis XVIII.</span>, made his public
entry into his capital, amidst the acclamations of the people, and
again occupied the palace of his ancestors.</p>

<p>It was also on the 8th that <span class="smcap">Napoleon Buonaparte</span> embarked,
at Rochefort, on board the French Frigate <i>La Saale</i>; and proceeded,
accompanied by <i>La Méduse</i>, in which was his suite, to the roads of the
Isle of Aix, with the intention of setting sail to America.</p>

<p>On the 10th, the wind became favourable: but a British Fleet made its
appearance; and <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, seeing the difficulty of eluding
the vigilance of its Cruisers, resolved, after having previously
communicated with Captain <span class="smcap">Maitland</span>, upon placing himself under
his protection on board the <i>Bellerophon</i>, which vessel he accordingly
reached on the 15th. On the following day, Captain <span class="smcap">Maitland</span>
sailed for England; and arrived at Torbay, with his illustrious charge,
on the 24th. The Ex-Emperor was not permitted to land; and the British
Government having decided upon sending him to the Island of St Helena,
he was removed to the <i>Northumberland</i> Man of War,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_758" id="Page_758">[Pg 758]</a></span> under Rear Admiral
Sir <span class="smcap">George Cockburn</span>, in which ship he sailed for that distant
rock; the final abode on earth of the man whose extraordinary career
marks the most stirring and eventful period in the history of Europe.</p>

<p>The Convention of Paris constituted a basis for the resumption
of negotiations for the General Peace which, a few months
before, had been so unexpectedly interrupted. The celebrated
Statesmen of that remarkable period&mdash;<span class="smcap">Castlereagh</span>,
<span class="smcap">Nesselrode</span>, <span class="smcap">Metternich</span>, <span class="smcap">Hardenberg</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Talleyrand</span>&mdash;aided by distinguished Representatives of the
minor European States, now perceived the importance of establishing a
more closely cemented Alliance; reconciling the clashing interests of
emulative Governments, securing the rights of the legitimate Sovereign
of France, and consolidating the re-established order of things in that
country.</p>

<p>The mere engagement of the French Government to a Treaty of Peace and
grateful amity was not considered a sufficient guarantee for the long
desired repose of Europe. France, which dictated laws according to
her own desires and interests to the entire Continent, was now, in
her turn, to be subjected to the most severe conditions. In order to
guarantee her compliance with the demands required of her by the wants
and necessities of the nations panting for that peace which was to
relieve their exhausted means, and to avert the dangers of internal
dissensions; she was destined to witness the occupation of her Frontier
Fortresses by a vast Army, comprising contingent forces from the Allied
Powers, and requiring to be maintained upon a full War Establishment at
her expense: whilst, at the same time, heavy contributions were laid
upon her for the purpose of indemnifying the Sovereigns who had been
compelled again to take up arms against her.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding these reverses and indemnities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_759" id="Page_759">[Pg 759]</a></span> France herself
is, perhaps, the country that has most benefited by that General Peace
which was established on the ruins of her Empire. The rational form
of Government which was secured to her by an enlarged Constitutional
Charter has gradually introduced among her people the most salutary
reforms, and the most liberal institutions; the stimulus given to
her industry by the cessation of harassing wars, of persecuting
conscriptions, and of vexatious imposts, rapidly obtained for her a
commercial prosperity to which she had long been a stranger; whilst
an unusual period of tranquillity has so completely renovated and
invigorated her resources, both moral and physical, as to place her
again in the rank of the highest Powers.</p>

<p>Now that the nation has completely recovered from the effects of the
convulsive throes which attended its dissolution as an Empire, and has
assumed the calm and dignified attitude of repose; in its resuscitated
strength it contemplates the past in a more rational and philosophic
spirit, balancing the evil with the good. If the public mind of France
dwell for a time upon the tyrannical exercise of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>'s
power upon the people; the sadness of the reflection is palliated by
his flattering, though personally ambitious, desire to render France
the Arbitress of Europe: if it perceive the rights of the citizens
subverted for the furtherance of his designs, the impression thus
produced vanishes at the contemplation of the <i>Code <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span></i>:
if it appear shocked by the general perversion of labour from its
natural sphere to purely military purposes; it is again soothed by
the grandeur in design, and utility in effect, of mighty enterprises,
conferring employment on myriads of artists and artisans: if it be
disposed to disapprove of the spoliation authorized in foreign States;
it is speedily flattered by the grand idea of rendering Paris the
centre of civilization and of the arts: and finally, if it feel pained
and subdued by a contemplation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_760" id="Page_760">[Pg 760]</a></span> disasters of Moscow, Vittoria,
Leipzic, and Waterloo; it revives and rejoices in recounting the
glorious triumphs of Marengo, Austerlitz, Jena, and Wagram.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If one country more than any other required a lasting Peace to enable
her to recover from the effects of the immense sacrifices she had
made, in life and treasure&mdash;sacrifices which proved, beyond doubt,
the Salvation of Europe&mdash;that country was Great Britain. Through
the intelligence of her Statesmen, the freedom of her Constitution,
the enterprise of her merchants, the industry of her artisans, and
the bravery of her naval and military defenders; she continues to
maintain her lofty position in the scale of nations, and even to
extend her Empire and her sway to the furthermost points of the earth.
But to whom is she mainly indebted for this proud pre-eminence,
this unparalleled grandeur? To such a question every Briton, no
matter what may be the direction of his political feelings or party
prejudices, will unhesitatingly reply&mdash;to the rare talent, the
untiring zeal, and practised skill of her Chief who led, as also to
the inflexible courage, extraordinary endurance, and the perfect
discipline of her sons who fought, her last and ever memorable struggle
on the Continent of Europe&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Battle of Waterloo</span>. It was
upon the solid foundation thus obtained that was raised that well
cemented superstructure, the solemn Compact of Sovereigns and States,
constituting the General Peace of 1815: and although, as time rolls on,
symptoms of decay may be traced in some portions of the edifice, still
it stands a monument of the downfall of an insatiable ambition aiming
at universal dominion; and continues to this day the surest guarantee
of the preservation of that equitable Balance of Power which can alone
secure the permanence of the tranquillity and prosperity of Europe.</p>

<p class="drop">THE Battle of Waterloo, followed as it was by the advance of the
Anglo-Allied and Prussian Armies upon Paris, was so decisive in its
effects, and so comprehensive in its results, that the great object
of the War&mdash;the destruction of the power of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> and the
restoration of the legitimate Sovereign&mdash;was attained while the Armies
of the Upper Rhine and of Italy were but commencing their invasion of
the French territory. Had the successes attendant upon the exertions
of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> and <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> assumed a less decisive
character, and, more especially, had reverses taken the place of those
successes; the operations of the Armies advancing from the Rhine and
across the Alps would have acquired an immense importance in the
history of the War: but the brilliant course of events in the north
of France materially diminished the interest excited by the military
transactions in other parts of the kingdom. Upon this ground it has
been considered, that to enter into any very detailed account of the
movements and dispositions of the Allies, on the eastern frontier,
is unnecessary; and that the completion of the present Work will be
sufficiently accomplished by the addition of a simple outline of the
daily progress and attendant circumstances of the advance of each Army
into the interior of the country.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Operations of the German Corps d'Armée.</i></p>


<p>This Corps, which was composed of contingent forces supplied by the
petty Princes of North Germany, was assembled, in the middle of April,
in the vicinity of Coblentz. It amounted to 26,200 men, divided into
thirty Battalions, twelve Squadrons, and two and a half Batteries;
and was placed under the command of General Count <span class="smcap">Kleist von
Nollendorf</span>. At a somewhat later period it crossed the Rhine at
Coblentz and Neuwied, and took up a position on the Moselle and the
Sarre; its Right communicating with the Third Prussian <i>Corps d'Armée</i>,
and its Left with the Bavarian troops at Zweibrücken. Its Advanced
Posts extended along the French frontier from Arlon to Mertzig. Its
Head Quarters were at Trier, on the Moselle.</p>

<p>In this position it remained until the 16th of June, when its
Commander, General <span class="smcap">von Engelhard</span> (in the absence of Count
<span class="smcap">Kleist</span>, who was ill), advanced from Trier to Arlon; which
it reached on the 19th. Here it continued until the 21st, when it
received an Order from Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> to move into France by
Bastogne and Neufchâteau; and to gain possession of the Fortresses of
Sedan and Bouillon. On the 22nd, the Corps commenced its march, in two
Columns: the one by Neufchâteau, upon Sedan; the other by Recogne, upon
Bouillon. Sedan, after a few days' bombardment, capitulated on the 25th
of June. An attempt was made to take Bouillon by a <i>coup de main</i>; but
its garrison was strong enough to frustrate this project. The place
was not considered of sufficient importance to render<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_766" id="Page_766">[Pg 766]</a></span> a regular siege
expedient, and it was therefore simply invested, from the 25th of June,
until the 21st of August; when it was blockaded at all points by troops
of the Netherlands, under Prince <span class="smcap">Frederick</span> of Orange.</p>

<p>On the 28th of June, Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">von Hacke</span>, who had
been appointed to the command of the German Corps, directed the
Advanced Guard to move upon Charleville, which lies under the guns of
the Fortress of Mézières, and to carry the place by storm. The capture
was successfully made by some Hessian Battalions, and tended greatly
to facilitate the siege of Mézières. Moveable Columns were detached to
observe the Fortresses of Montmédy, Laon, and Rheims. The last named
place was taken by capitulation on the 8th of July; and the garrison,
amounting to 4,000 men, retired behind the Loire.</p>

<p>Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">von Hacke</span> finding that, notwithstanding his
vigorous bombardment of Mézières, which he commenced on the 27th of
June, his summons to surrender was unheeded by the Commandant, General
<span class="smcap">Lemoine</span>, undertook a regular siege of the place, and opened
trenches on the 2nd of August. On the 13th, the French garrison gave up
the Town and retired into the Citadel, which surrendered on the 1st of
September.</p>

<p>The efforts of the Corps were now directed upon Montmédy, around which
Fortress it had succeeded in placing twelve Batteries in position by
the 13th of September. After an obstinate resistance, the garrison
concluded a convention on the 20th of September; by which it was to
retire, with arms and baggage, behind the Loire.</p>

<p>After the capture of Montmédy, the German <i>Corps d'Armée</i> went into
cantonments in the Department of the Ardennes; whence it returned home
in the month of November.</p>

<p>According to the general plan of operations projected by Prince
<span class="smcap">Schwartzenberg</span>, this Army was to cross the Rhine in two
Columns. The Right Column, consisting of the Third Corps, under Field
Marshal the Crown Prince of <span class="smcap">Würtemberg</span>; and of the Fourth
Corps, or the Bavarian Army, under Field Marshal Prince <span class="smcap">Wrède</span>,
was to cross the Rhine between Germersheim and Mannheim. The Left
Column, consisting of the First Corps, under the Master General of
the Ordnance, Count <span class="smcap">Colloredo</span>, and of the Second Corps,
under General Prince <span class="smcap">Hohenzollern Heckingen</span>, together with
the Austrian Reserve Corps; the whole being commanded by General the
Archduke <span class="smcap">Ferdinand</span>, was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_768" id="Page_768">[Pg 768]</a></span> cross the Rhine between Basle and
Rheinfelden. The Column formed by the Right Wing was to be supported by
the Russian Army, under Field Marshal Count <span class="smcap">Barclay de Tolly</span>,
which was expected to be collected at Kaiserslautern by the 1st of
July. The object of the operations, in the first instance, was the
concentration of the Army of the Upper Rhine and the Russian Army at
Nancy.</p>

<p>As soon as Prince <span class="smcap">Schwartzenberg</span> was made acquainted with
the commencement of hostilities in Belgium, he gave his Orders for
the advance of his Army. The Fourth, or Bavarian, <i>Corps d'Armée</i> was
directed immediately to cross the Sarre: and, by turning the Vosgian
Mountains, to cut off the French Corps under General <span class="smcap">Rapp</span>,
collected in the environs of Strasburg, from its base of operations;
and to intercept its communications with the interior of France.</p>

<p>A Russian Corps, under General Count <span class="smcap">Lambert</span>, forming the
Advance of the Army of Count <span class="smcap">Barclay de Tolly</span>, was united
to the <i>Corps d'Armée</i> of Prince <span class="smcap">Wrède</span>; who was to employ
it principally in keeping up the communication with the North German
<i>Corps d'Armée</i>, under Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">von Hacke</span>.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Fourth Corps d'Armée, Prince <span class="smcap">Wrède</span>.</i></p>

<p>On the 19th of June, the Bavarian Army crossed the Rhine at Mannheim
and Oppenheim, and advanced towards the Sarre. On the 20th, some
trifling affairs of Advanced Posts occurred near Landau and Dahn.
On the 23rd, the Army having approached the Sarre, proceeded, in
two Columns, to take possession of the passages across the River at
Saarbrück and Saargemünd.</p>

<p>The Right Column, under Lieutenant General Count <span class="smcap">Beckers</span>,
attacked Saarbrück; where it was opposed by the French General
<span class="smcap">Meriage</span>. The Bavarians carried the suburb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_769" id="Page_769">[Pg 769]</a></span> and the Bridge, and
penetrated into the Town along with the retiring French; of whom they
made four Officers and seventy men prisoners, and killed and wounded
one hundred men: suffering a loss, on their own part, of three Officers
and from fifty to sixty men killed and wounded. Count <span class="smcap">Beckers</span>
occupied the Town, posted his Division on the Heights towards Forbach:
and detached Patrols along the road to Metz, as far as St Avold; and to
the right along the Sarre, as far as Saarlouis.</p>

<p>The Left Column, consisting of the First Infantry Division, under
Lieutenant General Baron <span class="smcap">von Ragliovich</span>, and of the First
Cavalry Division, under His Royal Highness Prince <span class="smcap">Charles</span> of
Bavaria, advanced against Saargemünd; at which point the French had
constructed a <i>tête de pont</i> on the right bank of the river. After some
resistance, this was taken possession of by the Bavarians; whereupon
Baron <span class="smcap">von Ragliovich</span> marched through the Town, and took up
a position on the opposite Heights, commanding the roads leading to
Bouquenom and Lüneville.</p>

<p>The Fourth Infantry Division, under Lieutenant General Baron
<span class="smcap">Zollern</span>, advanced towards the Fortress of Bitsch; which,
however, the French Commandant, General <span class="smcap">Kreutzer</span>, refused to
surrender.</p>

<p>The Russian Corps, under Count <span class="smcap">Lambert</span>, attached to the Right
Wing of Prince <span class="smcap">Wrède</span>'s Army, advanced as far as Ottweiler and
Ramstein.</p>

<p>On the 24th, Prince <span class="smcap">Wrède</span> occupied Bouquenom; and detached the
Cavalry Division under Prince <span class="smcap">Charles</span> towards Pfalzburg, to
observe this place. His Second, Third, and Fourth Divisions, and the
Reserve, were collected at Saargemünd. The Russian troops under Count
<span class="smcap">Lambert</span> occupied Saarbrück; having previously detached the
Cavalry, under Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">Czernitscheff</span>, as far as St
Avold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_770" id="Page_770">[Pg 770]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 26th, Prince <span class="smcap">Wrède</span>'s Head Quarters were at Morhenge;
and, on the 27th, his Advanced Posts penetrated as far as Nancy, where
he established his Head Quarters on the 28th. From St Dieuze the
Prince detached to the left, in order to discover the march of General
<span class="smcap">Rapp</span>; who, however, was still on the Rhine, and whose retreat
had thus become cut off by the occupation of Nancy.</p>

<p>Prince <span class="smcap">Wrède</span> halted at Nancy, to await the arrival of the
Austrian and Russian <i>Corps d'Armée</i>. Upon his right, Lieutenant
General <span class="smcap">Czernitscheff</span> crossed the Moselle, on the 29th, within
sight of Metz; and carried by storm, on the 3rd of July, the Town of
Chalons sur Marne. The garrison of this place had promised to make no
resistance, and yet fired upon the Russian Advanced Guard; whereupon
the Cavalry immediately dismounted, scaled the ramparts, broke open the
gates, sabred a part of the garrison, made the remainder prisoners,
including the French General <span class="smcap">Rigault</span>, and pillaged the town.</p>

<p>After remaining four days in the vicinity of Nancy and
Lüneville, Prince <span class="smcap">Wrède</span> received an Order from Prince
<span class="smcap">Schwartzenberg</span> to move at once upon Paris, with the Fourth,
or Bavarian Corps; which was destined to become the Advanced Guard of
the Army of the Upper Rhine. This Order was given in consequence of
the desire expressed by the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> and Prince
<span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, that the Army of the Upper Rhine should afford
immediate support to their operations in front of Paris. On the 5th
of July, the main body of the Bavarian Army reached Chalons; in the
vicinity of which it remained during the 6th. On this day, its Advanced
Posts communicated, by Epernay, with the Prussian Army. On the 7th,
Prince <span class="smcap">Wrède</span> received intelligence of the Convention of Paris;
and, at the same time, directions to move towards the Loire. On the
8th,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_771" id="Page_771">[Pg 771]</a></span> Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">Czernitscheff</span> fell in with the Enemy
between St Prix and Montmirail; and drove him across the Morin, towards
the Seine. Previously to the arrival of the Corps at Château Thierry;
the French garrison had abandoned the place, leaving behind it several
pieces of cannon, with ammunition. On the 10th of July, the Bavarian
Army took up a position between the Seine and the Marne; and Prince
<span class="smcap">Wrède</span>'s Head Quarters were at La Ferté sous Jouarre.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Third Corps d'Armée, Crown Prince of <span class="smcap">Würtemberg</span>.</i></p>

<p>On the 22nd of June, a portion of the Third <i>Corps d'Armée</i>, under
the Crown Prince of <span class="smcap">Würtemberg</span>, took possession of the
intrenchments of Germersheim, on the left bank of the Rhine. Lieutenant
Field Marshal Count <span class="smcap">Wallmoden</span> was posted, with ten Battalions
and four Squadrons, in observation of the Fortress of Landau, and
the line of the Queich. The main body of the Corps stood between
Bruchsal and Philipsburg. On the 23d, the Corps crossed the Rhine at
Germersheim, and passed the line of the Queich without opposition.</p>

<p>The Crown Prince was directed to proceed by Weissenburg and Hagenau,
with a view to complete, in conjunction with the Fourth <i>Corps
d'Armée</i>, the plan of intercepting the retreat of General <span class="smcap">Rapp</span>.</p>

<p>On the 24th, the Corps advanced to Bergzabern and Nieder Ottersbach;
at both of which points it fell in with the Enemy, and drove him back.
Count <span class="smcap">Wallmoden</span> left a small Detachment to observe Landau;
and advanced, with the remainder of his force, as far as Rheinzabern.
On the 25th, the Crown Prince ordered the advance towards the lines
of Weissenburg, in two Columns. The first Column<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_772" id="Page_772">[Pg 772]</a></span> assembled at
Bergzabern, and the second moved forward by Nieder Ottersbach. Count
<span class="smcap">Wallmoden</span> was directed to advance upon Lauterburg. The Crown
Prince advanced his Corps still further along the Hagenau road. His
Advanced Guard pushed on to Inglesheim, and the main body of the Corps
reached the lines of Weissenburg; which the French abandoned in the
night, and fell back upon the Forest of Hagenau, occupying the large
Village of Surburg. On the 26th, the Crown Prince attacked and defeated
the Enemy at the last mentioned place, with his Right Column; whilst
the Left Column, under Count <span class="smcap">Wallmoden</span>, was equally successful
in an attack which it made upon the French General <span class="smcap">Rothenburg</span>,
posted, with 6,000 Infantry and a Regiment of Cavalry, at Selz. On
the following day, General <span class="smcap">Rapp</span> fell back upon the Defile of
Brümath; but this he quitted in the night, and took up a favourable
position in the rear of the Suffel, near Strasburg. His force comprised
twenty four Battalions of Infantry, four Regiments of Cavalry, and a
numerous Artillery, and amounted to nearly 24,000 men.</p>

<p>The Crown Prince of <span class="smcap">Würtemberg</span>, whose force amounted
altogether to more than 40,000 men, succeeded, on the 28th, after a
smart action, in forcing General <span class="smcap">Rapp</span> to retire within the
Fortress of Strasburg. The loss of the Third Corps on this occasion
amounted to 75 Officers, and 2,050 men, killed and wounded. That of the
French was about 3,000 men.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Austrian Reserve Corps, Archduke <span class="smcap">Ferdinand</span>.</i></p>

<p>The Third Corps remained in front of Strasburg until the 4th of July;
when it was relieved by the arrival of the Second Austrian Corps, under
Prince <span class="smcap">Hohenzollern</span>, from the vicinity of Colmar. At this
last point the Advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_773" id="Page_773">[Pg 773]</a></span> Guard of the Austrian Reserve Corps, under
Lieutenant Field Marshal <span class="smcap">Stutterheim</span>, moved upon Remiremont,
and the main body upon St Marie aux Mines. The Austrian Reserve Corps
itself reached Raon l'Etape; whence it subsequently moved (on the
10th) to Neufchâteau. The Third Corps, under the Crown Prince of
<span class="smcap">Würtemberg</span>, marched into the vicinity of Molsheim.</p>

<p>On the 7th of July, the Crown Prince reached Lüneville; but instead
of proceeding to Nancy, according to its original destination, the
Corps, on the 9th, took the road to Neufchâteau. The advance was in two
Columns; the one upon Bayon, and the other upon Rembervillers. These
two Columns moved respectively, the one, by Vaucouleurs, Joinville,
Brienne le Château, Troyes, and Auxonne; and the other, by Neufchâteau,
Chaumont, Bar sur Aube, Vendoeuvres, Bar sur Seine, and Chatillon: at
which points (Auxonne and Chatillon) they halted on the 18th. On the
21st, the Corps entered into cantonments between Montbard and Tonnerre.</p>


<p class="center"><i>First and Second Corps&mdash;Count <span class="smcap">Colloredo</span> and Prince <span class="smcap">von
Hohenzollern</span>.&mdash;Reserve Corps, Archduke <span class="smcap">Ferdinand</span>.</i></p>

<p>The First and Second Austrian <i>Corps d'Armée</i> and the Reserve Corps,
forming the Left Wing of the Army of the Upper Rhine, crossed this
river at Rheinfelden and Basle in the night of the 25th of June. On
the 26th, the First, under Count <span class="smcap">Colloredo</span>, was directed upon
Belfort and Montbelliard; and, on the same day, the Austrians invested
the Fortress of Huningen. The Advanced Guard of the First Corps had an
affair with a French Detachment of 3,000 men belonging to the Corps
of General <span class="smcap">Lecourbe</span>, and repulsed it as far as Donnemarie.
On the 28th, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_774" id="Page_774">[Pg 774]</a></span> First Corps fell in with the Enemy near Chabannes,
between Donnemarie and Belfort, when the French force, amounting to
8,000 Infantry and 500 Cavalry, was driven back upon Belfort. Major
General <span class="smcap">von Scheither</span> of the First Corps was detached against
Montbelliard, a town fortified and defended by a citadel. After having
maintained a most destructive fire against the place, the Austrian
troops carried it by storm; with a loss, however, of 25 Officers and
1,000 men, killed and wounded.</p>

<p>With the exception of a few sorties of little consequence, General
<span class="smcap">Rapp</span> remained very quiet in the Fortress of Strasburg. The
news of the capture of Paris by the British and Prussian troops led
to a Suspension of Hostilities; which was concluded on the 24th of
July, and extended to the Fortress of Strasburg, Landau, Lutzelstein,
Huningen, Schlettstadt, Lichtenberg, Pfalzburg, Neuf Brisac, and
Belfort.</p>


<p class="center"><i>The Russian Army.</i></p>

<p>The main body of the Russian Army, commanded by Field Marshal Count
<span class="smcap">Barclay de Tolly</span>, and amounting to 167,950 men, crossed the
Rhine at Mannheim, on the 25th of June; and followed the Army of the
Upper Rhine. The greater portion of it reached Paris and its vicinity
by the middle of July.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_775" id="Page_775">[Pg 775]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><i>Operations of the Army of Italy.</i></p>


<p>The Army of Italy, composed of Austrian and Sardinian troops, and
amounting to 60,000 men, was under the command of General Baron
<span class="smcap">Frimont</span>. It was destined to act against the Army of the Alps,
under Marshal <span class="smcap">Suchet</span>, posted in the vicinity of Chambery
and Grenoble. It is uncertain what was the amount of force under
<span class="smcap">Suchet</span>, it having been estimated from 13,000 to 20,000 men;
but the Corps of Observation on the Var, in the vicinity of Antibes and
Toulon, under Marshal <span class="smcap">Brune</span>, amounted to 10,000, and was not
occupied with any Enemy in its front.</p>

<p>Baron <span class="smcap">Frimont</span>'s Army was divided into two Corps: the one under
Lieutenant Field Marshal <span class="smcap">Radivojevich</span>, was to advance by the
Valais towards Lyons; and the other, which was in Piedmont, under
Lieutenant Field Marshal Count <span class="smcap">Bubna</span>, was to penetrate into
the south of France, through Savoy.</p>

<p>Marshal <span class="smcap">Suchet</span> had received Orders from <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>
to commence operations on the 14th of June; and by rapid marches to
secure the mountain Passes in the Valais and in Savoy, and close them
against the Austrians. On the 15th, his troops advanced at all points
for the purpose of gaining the frontier from Montmeilian, as far as
Geneva; which he invested. Thence he purposed to obtain possession
of the important Passes of Meillerie and St Maurice; and in this way
to check the advance of the Austrian Columns from the Valais. At
Meillerie the French were met and driven back by the Advanced Guard
of the Austrian Right Column, on the 21st of June. By means of forced
marches the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_776" id="Page_776">[Pg 776]</a></span> of this Column, which Baron <span class="smcap">Frimont</span> himself
accompanied, reached the Arve on the 27th of June.</p>

<p>The Left Column, under Count <span class="smcap">Bubna</span>, crossed Mount Cenis on
the 24th and 25th of June. On the 28th, it was sharply opposed by the
French at Conflans; of which place, however, the Austrians succeeded in
gaining possession.</p>

<p>In order to secure the passage of the Arve the Advanced Guard of the
Right Column detached, on the 27th, to Bonneville, on its left; but
the French, who had already fortified this place, maintained a stout
resistance. In the mean time, however, the Austrians gained possession
of the passage at Carrouge; by which means the French were placed under
the necessity of evacuating Bonneville, and abandoning the Valley of
the Arve. The Column now passed Geneva, and drove the Enemy from the
Heights of Grand Saconex and from St Genix. On the 29th, this part of
the Army moved towards the Jura; and, on the 1st July, it made its
dispositions for attacking the redoubts and intrenchments which the
French had thrown up to defend the Passes. The most vigorous assault
was made upon the Pass of Les Rousses; but the Austrians were driven
back. Reserves were then brought up; and the French having quitted
their intrenchments to meet the latter, and a good opportunity having
offered for a flank attack upon them with Cavalry and Artillery, the
Pass was captured by the Austrians: and the French were compelled to
abandon both it and the other Passes of the Jura. The Austrian Advanced
Guard pursued the Enemy, and reached, in the evening, St Claude, on
the road leading to the left from Gex; and St Laurent, in the original
direction of the attack, beyond Les Rousses.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the Austrian Reserve Corps, under Lieutenant Field
Marshal <span class="smcap">Meerville</span>, was directed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_777" id="Page_777">[Pg 777]</a></span> advance, and to throw
back the French upon the Rhone. The latter, in retreating, destroyed
the Bridge of Seyselle; and, by holding the Fort of l'Ecluse, closed
the road from Geneva to Lyons. A redoubt had been constructed in front
of the Fort, and completely commanded the approach. It was gallantly
stormed and carried by the Regiment of <span class="smcap">Esterhazy</span>. The Fort
itself was now turned by the Reserve Corps along the left bank of the
Rhone, with the design of forcing the passage at the Perte du Rhone.
Here the French had constructed a <i>tête de pont</i>; which, however,
they were forced to abandon in consequence of a movement made by the
First Corps under Lieutenant Field Marshal <span class="smcap">Radivojevich</span>. On
retiring, they destroyed the very beautiful stone bridge then existing;
and thus rendered it necessary for the Austrians to construct temporary
bridges over the extremely narrow space between the rocks which confine
the stream at this remarkable spot. The Advanced Guard of the Reserve
Corps, under General Count <span class="smcap">Hardegg</span>, first crossed the Rhone,
and found the Enemy posted at Charix, in rear of Chatillon, on the road
to Nantua. Count <span class="smcap">Hardegg</span> immediately attacked him; and, after
encountering an obstinate resistance, forced him to retire.</p>

<p>The troops of the First Austrian Corps, which, in the mean time, were
left in front of the Fort l'Ecluse, had commenced a bombardment; and
this, after twenty six hours' duration, considerably damaged the Fort.
A powder magazine exploded, which caused a general conflagration; to
escape which the garrison rushed out, and surrendered at discretion to
the Austrians: and thus, in three days, the high road from Geneva to
Lyons was opened to the Army of Italy.</p>

<p>On the 3rd July, General <span class="smcap">Bogdan</span>, with the Advanced Guard
of the First Austrian Corps, having been reinforced by Lieutenant
Field Marshal <span class="smcap">Radivojevich</span>, attacked the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_778" id="Page_778">[Pg 778]</a></span> Enemy with much
impetuosity at Ojanax, beyond St Claude; where the French General
<span class="smcap">Maransin</span> had taken up a favourable position, with 2,000 men.
The Austrians turned his Left Flank, and forced him to retire. The
Corps reached Bourg en Bresse on the 9th July.</p>

<p>On the 10th July, a Detachment, under Major General <span class="smcap">von
Pflüger</span>, was pushed on to Maçon on the Saône; and gained
possession of the <i>tête de pont</i> constructed there, and of the place
itself.</p>

<p>On the 7th July, the Second Corps, under Count <span class="smcap">Bubna</span>, reached
Echelles. A Detachment, consisting principally of Sardinian troops,
under Lieutenant General Count <span class="smcap">Latour</span>, had been directed to
observe Grenoble; in front of which its Advanced Guard arrived on the
4th July. On the 6th, the suburbs were attacked; and the communication
between this place and Lyons was cut off. The garrison, consisting of
eight Battalions of the National Guard, offered to capitulate on the
9th, on the condition of being permitted to return to their homes. That
a vigorous defence might have been maintained was evident from the fact
of the Austrians having found in the place fifty four guns and eight
mortars, and large quantities of provisions.</p>

<p>Count <span class="smcap">Bubna</span>'s Corps and the Reserve Corps, by simultaneous
movements, assembled together in front of Lyons on the 9th. An
Armistice was solicited by the garrison on the 11th July, and granted
upon condition that Lyons and the Intrenched Camp should be evacuated;
and that Marshal <span class="smcap">Suchet</span> should retire with his Corps behind
the Loire, keeping his Advanced Posts within a stipulated line of
demarcation.</p>

<p>Having secured possession of the line of the Rhone as far down as its
junction with the Isère, as also of that part of the Saône between
Maçon and Lyons; the Army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_779" id="Page_779">[Pg 779]</a></span> of Italy now proceeded towards the upper
line of the latter river, leaving the Second Corps, under Count
<span class="smcap">Bubna</span>, at Lyons, in front of Marshal <span class="smcap">Suchet</span>. The
First Corps marched upon Chalons sur Saône, in order to gain the <i>tête
de pont</i> at that point. At this time, the Fourth Division of the Army,
under the French General <span class="smcap">Lecourbe</span>, was at Salins, between
Dôle and Pontarlier: and as Besançon had not yet been invested, Baron
<span class="smcap">Frimont</span> detached a part of the Reserve Corps, under General
<span class="smcap">Hecht</span>, to Salins; whilst General <span class="smcap">Fölseis</span>, detached
from the First Corps towards Dôle. The Advanced Guard of the First
Corps had arrived in front of the <i>tête de pont</i> at Chalons, and had
completed its dispositions for attack; when the place surrendered.
By the advance, at the same time, of <span class="smcap">Hecht</span> upon Salins,
and of <span class="smcap">Fölseis</span> from Dôle upon Besançon; the retreat of the
French General <span class="smcap">Laplane</span> was completely cut off. This led to a
Convention which stipulated the dissolution of the National Guards, the
surrender of all the Officers, and the abandonment of one of the Forts
of Salins to the Austrians.</p>

<p>On the 20th, the First <i>Corps d'Armée</i> advanced from Chalons sur Saône
as far as Autun; and Besançon having in the mean time been occupied
by the Austrian troops of the Army of the Upper Rhine, a junction was
effected with the latter by the Army of Italy by Dijon.</p>

<p>The Sardinian General <span class="smcap">d'Osasca</span>, who had been detached to Nice,
concluded on the 9th of July an Armistice with Marshal <span class="smcap">Brune</span>,
who commanded the Army of the Var, in front of the Maritime Alps; and
thus terminated all hostilities on that side of France.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The foregoing Outline will suffice to show the nature, extent, and
interconnection of the operations of the Allied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_780" id="Page_780">[Pg 780]</a></span> Armies which invaded
France along her eastern and south-eastern frontier; and at the same
time afford a clear proof that amongst the more immediate consequences
of the decisive Battle of Waterloo and speedy capture of Paris must be
ranked that of their having been the means of averting the more general
and protracted warfare which would probably have taken place, had a
different result in Belgium emboldened the French to act with vigour
and effect in other parts of the country.</p>

<p>Prince <span class="smcap">Augustus</span> had made every preparation for commencing the
siege of Charlemont and its connecting Forts, the two Givets and the
Mont d'Hours, on the 8th of September, when the Commandant, General
<span class="smcap">Burcke</span>, foreseeing that the occupation of the detached
Forts would divide his force too much, entered into negotiations,
and surrendered those works on the 10th, withdrawing his troops into
Charlemont; the bombardment of which was to have opened on the 23rd
of September: but, on the 20th, Prince <span class="smcap">Augustus</span> received
information from Paris that hostilities were to cease throughout the
whole of France.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 55%;">Waterloo, June 19, 1815.</span><br />
</p>

<p>My Lord,&mdash;Bonaparte having collected the First, Second, Third, Fourth
and Sixth Corps of the French Army and the Imperial Guards, and nearly
all the Cavalry, on the Sambre, and between that river and the Meuse,
between the 10th and 14th of the month, advanced on the 15th, and
attacked the Prussian Posts at Thuin and Lobez, on the Sambre, at
daylight in the morning.</p>

<p>I did not hear of these events till the evening of the 15th, and I
immediately ordered the troops to prepare to march; and afterwards to
march to their left, as soon as I had intelligence from other quarters,
to prove that the Enemy's movement upon Charleroi was the real attack.</p>

<p>The Enemy drove the Prussian Posts from the Sambre on that day; and
General <span class="smcap">Zieten</span>, who commanded the Corps which had been at
Charleroi, retired upon Fleurus; and Marshal Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>
concentrated the Prussian Army upon Sombref, holding the Villages, in
front of his position, of St Amand and Ligny.</p>

<p>The Enemy continued his march along the road from Charleroi towards
Bruxelles, and on the same evening, the 15th, attacked a Brigade of the
Army of the Netherlands, under the Prince <span class="smcap">de Weimar</span>, posted at
Frasne, and forced it back to the Farm House on the same road, called
Les Quatre Bras.</p>

<p>The Prince of <span class="smcap">Orange</span> immediately reinforced this Brigade with
another of the same Division, under General <span class="smcap">Perponcher</span>, and
in the morning early regained part of the ground which had been lost,
so as to have command of the communication leading from Nivelles and
Bruxelles, with Marshal <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>'s position.</p>

<p>In the mean time I had directed the whole Army to march upon Les Quatre
Bras; and the Fifth Division, under Lieutenant General Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas
Picton</span>, arrived about half past two in the day, followed by the
Corps of troops under the Duke of <span class="smcap">Brunswick</span>, and afterwards by
the contingent of Nassau.</p>

<p>At this time the Enemy commenced an attack upon Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>
with his whole force; excepting the First and Second Corps, and a Corps
of Cavalry under General <span class="smcap">Kellermann</span>, with which he attacked
our Posts at Les Quatre Bras.</p>

<p>The Prussian Army maintained their position with their usual gallantry
and perseverance, against a great disparity of numbers, as the Fourth
Corps of their Army, under General <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>, had not yet joined,
and I was not able to assist them as I wished, as I was attacked
myself, and the troops, the Cavalry in particular, which had a long
distance to march, had not arrived.</p>

<p>We maintained our position also, and completely defeated and
repulsed all the Enemy's attempts to get possession of it. The Enemy
repeatedly attacked us with a large body of Infantry and Cavalry,
supported by a numerous and powerful Artillery; he made several
charges with the Cavalry upon our Infantry, but all were repulsed in
the steadiest manner. In this affair His Royal Highness the Prince
of <span class="smcap">Orange</span>, the Duke of <span class="smcap">Brunswick</span>, and Lieutenant
General Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Picton</span>, and Major General Sir <span class="smcap">James
Kempt</span>, and Sir <span class="smcap">Denis Pack</span>, who were engaged from the
commencement of the Enemy's attack, highly distinguished themselves, as
well as Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">Charles Baron Alten</span>, Major General
Sir <span class="smcap">C. Halkett</span>, Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">Cooke</span>, and Major
Generals <span class="smcap">Maitland</span> and <span class="smcap">Byng</span>, as they successively
arrived. The troops of the Fifth Division, and those of the Brunswick
Corps were long and severely engaged, and conducted themselves with the
utmost gallantry. I must particularly mention the 28th, 42nd, 79th, and
92nd Regiments, and the Battalions of Hanoverians.</p>

<p>Our loss was great, as your Lordship will perceive by the enclosed
return; and I have particularly to regret His Serene Highness the Duke
of <span class="smcap">Brunswick</span>, who fell fighting gallantly at the head of his
troops.</p>

<p>Although Marshal <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> had maintained his position at
Sombref, he still found himself much weakened by the severity of the
contest in which he had been engaged; and as the Fourth Corps had not
arrived, he determined to fall back, and concentrate his Army upon
Wavre; and he marched in the night after the action was over.</p>

<p>This movement of the Marshal's rendered necessary a corresponding one
on my part; and I retired from the Farm of Quatre Bras upon Genappe,
and thence upon Waterloo the next morning, the 17th, at ten o'clock.</p>

<p>The Enemy made no effort to pursue Marshal <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_829" id="Page_829">[Pg 829]</a></span>
contrary, a Patrol which I sent to Sombref in the morning, found all
quiet, and the Enemy's Videttes fell back as the Patrol advanced.
Neither did he attempt to molest our march to the rear, although made
in the middle of the day; excepting by following with a large body
of Cavalry, brought from his Right, the Cavalry under the Earl of
<span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span>.</p>

<p>This gave Lord <span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span> an opportunity of charging them with
the 1st Life Guards, upon their debouch from the Village of Genappe;
upon which occasion his Lordship has declared himself to be well
satisfied with that Regiment.</p>

<p>The position which I took up in the front of Waterloo, crossed the
high roads from Charleroi and Nivelle, and had its Right thrown back
to a ravine near Merke Braine, which was occupied; and its Left
extended to a Height above the Hamlet Ter la Haye, which was likewise
occupied.&mdash;In front of the Right Centre, and near the Nivelle road, we
occupied the House and Garden of Hougomont, which covered the return of
that Flank; and in the front of the Left Centre we occupied the Farm
of La Haye Sainte. By our left we communicated with Marshal Prince
<span class="smcap">Blücher</span> at Wavre through Ohaim; and the Marshal had promised
me, that in case we should be attacked he would support me with one or
more Corps, as might be necessary.</p>

<p>The Enemy collected his Army, with the exception of the Third Corps,
which had been sent to observe Marshal <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, on a range
of Heights in our front, in the course of the night of the 17th and
yesterday morning: and at about ten o'clock he commenced a furious
attack upon our Post at Hougomont. I had occupied that Post with a
Detachment from General <span class="smcap">Byng</span>'s Brigade of Guards, which
was in position in its rear; and it was for some time under the
command of Lieutenant Colonel <span class="smcap">Macdonel</span>, and afterwards of
Colonel <span class="smcap">Home</span>; and I am happy to add, that it was maintained
throughout the day with the utmost gallantry by these brave troops,
notwithstanding the repeated efforts of large bodies of the Enemy to
obtain possession of it.</p>

<p>This attack upon the Right of our Centre was accompanied by a very
heavy cannonade upon our whole Line, which was destined to support
the repeated attacks of Cavalry and Infantry occasionally mixed, but
sometimes separate, which were made upon it. In one of these the Enemy
carried the Farm House of La Haye Sainte; as the Detachment of the
Light Battalion of the Legion which occupied it, had expended all its
ammunition, and the Enemy occupied the only communication there was
with them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_830" id="Page_830">[Pg 830]</a></span></p>

<p>The Enemy repeatedly charged our Infantry with his Cavalry, but these
attacks were uniformly unsuccessful; and they afforded opportunities
to our Cavalry to charge, in one of which, Lord <span class="smcap">E. Somerset</span>'s
Brigade, consisting of the Life Guards, Royal Horse Guards, and 1st
Dragoon Guards, highly distinguished themselves, as did that of Major
General Sir <span class="smcap">W. Ponsonby</span>, having taken many prisoners and an
Eagle.</p>

<p>These attacks were repeated till about seven in the evening, when the
Enemy made a desperate effort with the Cavalry and Infantry, supported
by the fire of the Artillery, to force our Left Centre near the Farm
of La Haye Sainte, which after a severe contest was defeated: and
having observed that the troops retired from this attack in great
confusion, and that the march of General <span class="smcap">Bülow</span>'s Corps by
Euschermont upon Planchenoit and La Belle Alliance had begun to take
effect, and as I could perceive the fire of his cannon, and as Marshal
Prince <span class="smcap">Blücher</span> had joined in person, with a Corps of his Army
to the left of our Line by Ohaim; I determined to attack the Enemy,
and immediately advanced the whole Line of Infantry, supported by the
Cavalry and Artillery.</p>

<p>The attack succeeded in every point; the Enemy was forced from his
position on the Heights, and fled in the utmost confusion; leaving
behind him, as far as I could judge, one hundred and fifty pieces of
cannon, with their ammunition, which fell into our hands. I continued
the pursuit till long after dark, and then discontinued it only on
account of the fatigue of our troops, who had been engaged during
twelve hours, and because I found myself on the same road with Marshal
<span class="smcap">Blücher</span>, who assured me of his intention to follow the Enemy
throughout the night; he has sent me word this morning that he has
taken sixty pieces of cannon belonging to the Imperial Guard, and
several carriages, baggage, &amp;c., belonging to <span class="smcap">Buonaparte</span>, in
Genappe.</p>

<p>I propose to move, this morning, upon Nivelles, and not to discontinue
my operations.</p>

<p>Your Lordship will observe, that such a desperate action could not be
fought, and such advantages could not be gained, without great loss;
and I am sorry to add that ours has been immense. In Lieutenant General
Sir <span class="smcap">Thomas Picton</span>, His Majesty has sustained the loss of an
Officer who has frequently distinguished himself in his Service, and
he fell gloriously leading his Division to a charge with bayonets, by
which one of the most serious attacks made by the Enemy on our position
was defeated. The Earl of <span class="smcap">Uxbridge</span>, after having successfully
got through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_831" id="Page_831">[Pg 831]</a></span> this arduous day, received a wound by almost the last shot
fired; which will, I am afraid, deprive His Majesty for some time of
his services.</p>

<p>His Royal Highness the Prince of <span class="smcap">Orange</span> distinguished himself
by his gallantry and conduct till he received a wound from a musket
ball through the shoulder, which obliged him to quit the Field.</p>

<p>It gives me the greatest satisfaction to assure your Lordship, that
the Army never, upon any occasion, conducted itself better. The
Division of Guards, under Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">Cooke</span> (who is
severely wounded), Major General <span class="smcap">Maitland</span>, and Major General
<span class="smcap">Byng</span>, set an example which was followed by all; and there is
no Officer nor description of troops, that did not behave well.</p>

<p>I must, however, particularly mention, for His Royal Highness's
approbation, Lieutenant General Sir <span class="smcap">H. Clinton</span>, Major General
<span class="smcap">Adam</span>, Lieutenant General <span class="smcap">Charles Baron Alten</span>,
severely wounded; Major General Sir <span class="smcap">Colin Halkett</span>, severely
wounded; Colonel <span class="smcap">Ompteda</span>, Colonel <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>,
commanding a Brigade of the Fourth Division; Major General Sir
<span class="smcap">James Kempt</span> and Sir <span class="smcap">Denis Pack</span>, Major General
<span class="smcap">Lambert</span>, Major General Lord <span class="smcap">E. Somerset</span>, Major
General Sir <span class="smcap">W. Ponsonby</span>, Major General Sir <span class="smcap">C. Grant</span>,
and Major General Sir <span class="smcap">H. Vivian</span>; Major General Sir <span class="smcap">O.
Vandeleur</span>; Major General Count <span class="smcap">Dörnberg</span>. I am
particularly indebted to General Lord <span class="smcap">Hill</span> for his assistance
and conduct upon this as upon all former occasions.</p>

<p>The Artillery and Engineer departments were conducted much to
my satisfaction by Colonel Sir <span class="smcap">G. Wood</span> and Colonel
<span class="smcap">Smyth</span>; and I had every reason to be satisfied with the conduct
of the Adjutant General Major General <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>, who was wounded;
and of the Quartermaster General Colonel <span class="smcap">Delancy</span>, who was
killed by a cannon shot in the middle of the action. This Officer is
a serious loss to His Majesty's Service and to me at this moment. I
was likewise much indebted to the assistance of Lieutenant Colonel
Lord <span class="smcap">Fitzroy Somerset</span>, who was severely wounded; and of the
Officers composing my personal Staff, who have suffered severely in
this action. Lieutenant Colonel the Hon. Sir <span class="smcap">Alexander Gordon</span>,
who has died of his wounds, was a most promising Officer, and is a
serious loss to His Majesty's Service.</p>

<p>General <span class="smcap">Kruse</span> of the Nassau Service, likewise conducted
himself much to my satisfaction; as did General <span class="smcap">Trip</span>,
commanding the Heavy Brigade of Cavalry, and General
<span class="smcap">Vanhope</span>, commanding a Brigade of Infantry of the King of the
<span class="smcap">Netherlands</span>.</p>

<p>General <span class="smcap">Pozzo di Borgo</span>, General Baron <span class="smcap">Vincent</span>,
General <span class="smcap">Müffling</span>, and General <span class="smcap">Alava</span>, were in the
Field during the action, and rendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_832" id="Page_832">[Pg 832]</a></span> me every assistance in their
power. Baron <span class="smcap">Vincent</span> is wounded, but I hope not severely; and
General <span class="smcap">Pozzo di Borgo</span> received a contusion.</p>

<p>I should not do justice to my feelings, or to Marshal <span class="smcap">Blücher</span>
and the Prussian Army, if I did not attribute the successful result of
this arduous day to the cordial and timely assistance I received from
them.</p>

<p>The operation of General <span class="smcap">Bülow</span> upon the Enemy's Flank was a
most decisive one; and even if I had not found myself in a situation
to make the attack which produced the final result, it would have
forced the Enemy to retire, if his attacks should have failed; and
would have prevented him from taking advantage of them, if they should
unfortunately have succeeded.</p>

<p>I send, with this despatch, two Eagles taken by the troops in this
action; which Major <span class="smcap">Percy</span> will have the honour of laying at
the feet of His Royal Highness.</p>

<p class="ph2">RUPERT PRINCE PALATINE.</p>

<p>By EVA SCOTT.</p>

<p>Late Scholar of Somerville College, Oxford.</p>

<p>With Photogravure frontispiece.</p>

<p><i>New and cheaper Edition.</i> Large Crown 8vo, 6s.</p>


<p>"The book is well written in a good style, is throughout most moderate
and accurate, and is a worthy record of the gallant and true-hearted
Rupert of the Rhine."&mdash;<i>Literature.</i></p>

<p>"This well-illustrated and well-printed book is a very distinct
addition to our historical biographies. It is strange that no serious
life of the gallant Prince Rupert should have been written till now,
but no one could have written with fuller knowledge or more genuine
enthusiasm than Miss Eva Scott. She has ignored few if any of the
manifold sources of information, printed and manuscript, from which the
chequered history of the great soldier can be gleaned, and the result
of work which must have been both assiduous and intelligent is a really
admirable and complete historical study."&mdash;<i>Guardian.</i></p>

<p>"A final word as to this book itself. It is well got up, well indexed,
and well illustrated. There is a preface which gives a general view of
the material used, and a series of careful footnotes that will aid the
student."&mdash;Prof. Yorke Powell in the <i>Morning Post.</i></p>

<p>"Miss Scott, on the other hand, has not only made herself familiar
with Rupert and his surroundings, but is possessed of&mdash;what is seldom
to be found&mdash;a rare talent for biographical presentment. Not only is
there no overburdening of the narrative with documentary evidence, but
everything of that nature which is introduced strengthens the author's
argument instead of distracting the attention of the reader."&mdash;Mr. S.R.
Gardiner in the <i>English Historical Review.</i></p>

<p>"Though she properly makes a hero of Rupert, she is never blind to
his failings nor does she extol his virtues without the warrant of
documentary evidence. In brief, her monograph is a well-considered,
impartial piece of work."&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>

<p class="ph2">THE HOUSEHOLD<br />

OF THE LAFAYETTES.</p>

<p>By EDITH SICHEL.</p>

<p>With Photogravure frontispiece.</p>

<p><i>New Popular Edition.</i> Large Crown 8vo, 6s.</p>


<p>"In the 'Household of the Lafayettes' Miss Sichel has given a very
vivid and picturesque study of French life during the revolutionary
period, mainly from the political and social point of view. Her
style is on the whole well suited to her subject.... The book is a
fascinating one, and of far greater interest than the majority of
novels. We are carried along from chapter to chapter in very good
company, and on very easy wings."&mdash;<i>Morning Post.</i></p>

<p>"Miss Sichel possesses a lively and agreeable style, characterized
by a refreshing absence of stock phrases. She does not disgust us
with the obvious, or harass us with the unexpected; and her general
observations&mdash;always a good test of an author's wits&mdash;are shrewd and
happily expressed."&mdash;<i>Pall Mall Gazette.</i></p>

<p>"The conversations between the First Consul and the General reproduced
in this most interesting chapter of an interesting book shed the most
instructive light on the character of two of the greatest, probably the
greatest Frenchmen that either century had produced. In her laborious
and sympathetic biography of the lesser of the two Miss Sichel has
evolved a work which for picturesque yet faithful detail, should
rank highly among the records of the most eventful period in French
History."&mdash;<i>Observer.</i></p>

<p>"We should have liked to quote many passages, picturesque touches of
daily life, remarks of real political insight, clear views of the
people and the tendencies of the age. But we must reserve space for
a few words about Miss Sichel's introduction, which is one of the
best and truest pieces of writing that we have met with for a long
time."&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>




<p class="ph2">The Kingdom of the Yellow Robe</p>

<p>Being Sketches of the Domestic and Religious Rites and Ceremonies of
the Siamese.</p>

<p>By ERNEST YOUNG.</p>

<p>Fully Illustrated by <span class="smcap">E.A. Norbury, R.C.A.</span> and from Photographs.</p>

<p><i>New Popular Edition.</i> Large Crown 8vo, 6s.</p>


<p>"A pleasantly written little book, popular and light in style. The
author, who was connected with the Siamese Education Department, is at
his best in the first few chapters, wherein he describes the scenes of
the city and the domestic life of the people. His educational duties
enabled him to note some specially interesting facts with regard to the
extraordinary aptness and intelligence which Siamese children as a rule
display...."&mdash;<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>"Of the quaint courtship customs in the strange land where there are
no old maids, and of many other curious things, we have, alas! no
room to tell. It is with a feeling of regret that we put down this
pleasant book, and take leave of so charming and interesting a people
as that which inhabits the land of the Yellow Robe. The book is fully
illustrated by Mr. E.A. Norbury and from photographs, which add greatly
to its interest. It is a book to be read both for entertainment and
instruction."&mdash;<i>St. James's Budget.</i></p>

<p>"Here is a book of which I can speak with unstinted praise. It is not
often that I find myself longing to get back to any book, unless it be
a novel of extraordinary power; but I had this sensation with regard to
this volume. It is a book difficult to drop from the first moment it is
taken in hand, and one to which the reader returns with real delight.
It is partly, one must admit, because there is much fascination in the
subject, but it is also because the narrative is so simple, lucid,
satisfying."&mdash;T.P. O'Connor in the <i>Graphic.</i></p>

<p>"We are glad to see that Messrs. Constable have just reissued Sir
William Conway's charmingly written and beautifully illustrated volume.
It is a book which all climbers have read with pleasure."&mdash;<i>Daily News.</i></p>

<p>"A high place among these books of climbing which appeal to many who
cannot climb, as well as to all who can, will be taken by the very
pleasant volume 'The Alps from End to End.'"&mdash;<i>The Times.</i></p>

<p>"There is, perhaps, not another living Alpinist&mdash;unless we except Mr.
Coolidge who contributes a valuable précis of the topography&mdash;who could
have combined the requisite knowledge with physical capacity for the
task.... Sir William Conway's book is as vivid as it is charming....
Mr. M'Cormick's illustrations are, indeed, so vivid that many will be
tempted to follow 'The Alps from End to End.'"&mdash;<i>Standard.</i></p>

<p>"The amount of variety Mr. M'Cormick can secure in a series of
pictures, whose component parts of sky, snow, rock, and ice, must be
seen to be believed."&mdash;<i>Daily Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>With over 100 Illustrations. Large Crown 8vo, 6s.</p>

<p>"The book is moderate in size, beautifully printed on unloaded paper,
rich in illustrations exceedingly well reproduced from photographs,
conveying an impressive conception of the scenery and people which form
their subjects."&mdash;<i>The Times.</i></p>

<p>"This book, in which Major Waddell sets forth the results of his
investigation of the Himalayas, will be appreciated by geographers as
a valuable contribution to our limited knowledge of a little-explored
region. With the exception of Hooker, no European has got nearer
to Mount Everest than the author, and his observations of this and
the adjacent peaks, in combination with the admirable photographs
that he provides, form a feature of the work that deserves special
attention."&mdash;<i>Morning Post.</i></p>

<p>This Work is the most exact, complete, and authoritative account
in our language of what is sometimes called The Hundred Days' War,
and sometimes The Twenty Days' Campaign; including the Battles of
Ligny, Quatre Bras, Waterloo, and Wavre. It is written with great
impartiality, being as fair to the French as to the Allies.</p>

<p>Every movement is clearly described; and the name of every Commander

<p>The Work also includes, Regiment by Regiment, the names of all the
Officers of the British Army who were at Waterloo; distinguishing such

solid information and the masses of statistics the book contains,
the 'Wayside Sketches' of life, manners and scenery around the

<blockquote>

<p>"In these pages bills of fare for one week, according to the season
of the year, have been carefully arranged for a household of six or
eight persons. After a perusal of these menus, some housekeepers may
imagine that it would be impossible to provide such a variety of food
at so small a cost. The author, however, shows that with proper care
and economy, it can be accomplished. The work is specially suitable
to those who have carefully to consider the question of ways and
means."&mdash;<i>The Morning Post.</i></p>

<p>"Should prove a very good guide to young housekeepers beginning their
business. It is an economical little work and certainly shows how to
get the most out of the sum allowed."&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>

from despair."&mdash;<i>The Queen.</i></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>"Those who feel unable to cope with the subject of the house
beautiful, without advice, should seek guidance from Mrs. C.S. Peel,
who, in her new book&mdash;The New Home&mdash;offers some delightful and
practical suggestions upon this interesting topic. Her words appeal
to a very wide class, and will bring relief to many a home where a
real desire for pretty rooms exists. Its many chapters, written by an
acknowledged authority cannot fail to be useful."&mdash;<i>Woman.</i></p>

<p>"A useful book, treating of the arrangement, decoration and furnishing
of a house of medium size, to be maintained by a moderate income.
It contains many useful hints; and by means of illustrations gives
good ideas of how best to arrange a house and to provide useful
accessories."&mdash;<i>The Weekly Sun.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>"Miss Mary Johnston's former novel prepared the reader to welcome
her name on a title-page, and 'By Order of the Company' will not
disappoint such expectations, for it is quite as good reading as 'The
Old Dominion.' The picture of the very earliest days of Virginia is
excellently painted, and the personages of the story are sympathetic
and interesting."&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>

<p>"If 'The Old Dominion' had not previously attracted attention, her new
story must have assured her reputation."&mdash;<i>Manchester Guardian.</i></p>

<p>"So exact in historical colour, so rich in glowing imagination and
stirring adventure, so full of pictorial charm and poetic description,
so charged with emotion and tender melancholy was 'The Old Dominion,'
that it was with lively anticipations that I turned to 'By Order of
the Company,' and I find no justification for disappointment."&mdash;<i>The

<p>The Cover specially designed by <span class="smcap">J.T. Nettleship</span>.</p>

<p>3s. 6d.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'The Taming of the Jungle' is one of the most striking books of
Indian life that we have seen since Mr. Kipling produced his 'Plain
Tales from the Hills,' and it does not suffer by comparison with the
work that made Mr. Kipling famous."&mdash;<i>Literature.</i></p>

<p>"One needs no previous knowledge of this folk of the Terai, away
there under the Himalayas, to appreciate the insight and observation
which characterise every stroke of the charming sketches. It would be
altogether unfair to say that the author owes his inspiration to Mr.
Kipling. He speaks from long and close experience; and, what is better
still, his note is his own.... In a brilliant illustration by Mr.
Nettleship, full of fire and movement, the beasts of the jungle are
seen careering across the back of the book. The covers, in fact, have
been drawn as well as any huntsman could do it."&mdash;<i>Punch.</i></p>

<p>"The author has evidently lived among the people and closely studied
their ways, so that, while the picture that he presents is engaging,
it also conveys a sense of verisimilitude."&mdash;<i>Morning Post.</i></p>

<p>"I am impelled to say a word in warm praise of the extremely pleasant
little book of Indian stories, without caring a fig for the purely
academic question as to whether they would have been put forth exactly
as they stand had Mr. Kipling never lived. Dr. Doyle knows the folk of
the Terai intimately; he has the power of spinning a good story out
of the good stuff with which his memory is stored."&mdash;T.P. O'Connor in

stands by itself and owes nothing to any one model."&mdash;<i>Speaker.</i></p>

<p>"This is a scholarly, well-written, and interesting book, not without a
good deal both of humour and of pathos."&mdash;<i>Manchester Guardian.</i></p>

<p>"The views put forward throughout the volume, whether or not the
writer's own, are always worth considering, even when we dissent from
them&mdash;certainly they cannot be lightly put aside. And the book is
excellent reading, for it is full of vigorous and weighty sayings and
full of humour too."&mdash;<i>Guardian.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"For the gifts of Miss Fiona Macleod, it is impossible to use the
common words of gratitude. To people who live in a paved city, or a
half-paved suburb, dimly conscious of sky and aware of the voice of
the wind only when a gale sings in the telegraph wires, her writings
are as the water of life. We know not, neither do we care, whether
Fiona Macleod be man, woman, or spirit, though we suppose her treasure
is hidden in an earthen vessel. Enough for us that she hears, as only
poets hear, the old authentic voices of the world."&mdash;<i>Daily Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>"Of the extreme beauty and subtlety of Miss Fiona Macleod's writing
there is no need now to speak. She has caught the habit of the true
Gael; who sees an idea in a picture and expresses a thought in a

<p>"Mr. Ford has the right feeling for romance; he knows how to bring his

our minds revert to such tales as 'The Mysteries of Adolpho,'

gloomy fascination than any one of these."&mdash;<i>Daily Mail.</i></p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
